Hey what's up.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.530
This is Jason with Dave dot com.

00:08.540 --> 00:14.010
And in this video we're going to answer the question Where should you start as a beginner web developer.

00:14.210 --> 00:17.340
Well there are three basic concepts to web development.

00:17.390 --> 00:19.910
H.M. C Ss and Javascript.

00:19.910 --> 00:21.340
Now first you're going to start with.

00:21.380 --> 00:25.290
H l h g mail is as basic as it gets.

00:25.340 --> 00:28.260
It's what provides all the structure and the layout of a Web site.

00:28.370 --> 00:30.580
It's how you place different elements around the page.

00:30.620 --> 00:37.880
Think of HMO as the skeleton of our body our skeletons give us a basic structure or skeleton's structure

00:37.880 --> 00:43.880
how our arms our legs our joints and the other building blocks of our bodies are laid out.

00:43.940 --> 00:48.410
This will give you your first look under the hood so you can understand how websites are built.

00:48.410 --> 00:50.520
Next you're going to want to learn see assess.

00:50.530 --> 00:55.520
Now this is really cool because you're going to be able to take two concepts smell and see assess and

00:55.520 --> 00:58.520
you're going to learn how to get them to work together.

00:58.520 --> 01:05.150
All right hand-in-hand so you can think of success as like the skin that goes over the skeleton right

01:05.630 --> 01:12.140
all the way down to the details like the skin color eye color hair color dimples freckles all those

01:12.140 --> 01:12.650
things.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.950
That is the design side of success.

01:15.980 --> 01:20.640
So you've got your HMO and you've got your skeleton then you're going to make it look pretty we'll see.

01:20.660 --> 01:26.480
All right it's what gives the personality and the design and the are to website after you've learned

01:26.540 --> 01:31.970
the basics of smell and see assess you're then going to want to learn the basic core fundamentals of

01:31.970 --> 01:33.170
javascript.

01:33.170 --> 01:38.360
Things like variable strings numbers operators arrays objects things like that.

01:38.390 --> 01:41.720
Now javascript is like the brains of a Web site.

01:41.900 --> 01:48.200
It's what allows a Web site to think allows users to interact and use different type of features on

01:48.200 --> 01:48.940
a Web site.

01:49.010 --> 01:55.520
You can think of javascript like the innards of your body like the heart the lungs your stomach your

01:55.520 --> 01:59.270
kidneys all those things that allow your body to function.

01:59.390 --> 02:02.070
Javascript will do the same thing for a website.

02:02.150 --> 02:06.870
These are the three basic concepts of web development that you should learn first.

02:06.940 --> 02:09.770
H M L C S S and Javascript.

02:09.770 --> 02:15.110
After you learn this you'll have a good basic understanding of web development and you can start exploring

02:15.110 --> 02:21.380
other javascript frameworks like angular and re-act for example and start going ham on smell and see

02:21.430 --> 02:21.810
SS.
