00:08.750 --> 00:12.460
Hey What's up everybody this is Jason with slopes dot com.

00:12.470 --> 00:16.720
And in this video we are going to learn about C specifics.

00:16.850 --> 00:21.610
I'll say it in slow motion so you understand what I'm saying specificity.

00:21.770 --> 00:25.820
So anyways during this video I am going to be slaughtering that word.

00:25.820 --> 00:27.770
But don't worry about it.

00:28.130 --> 00:30.800
But the concept of this is very very important.

00:30.800 --> 00:40.940
So basically what specificity means is it's it takes and adds a weight value to different selectors

00:40.940 --> 00:48.350
So we've got elements selectors class selectors IDs selectors things like that and then it adds a kind

00:48.350 --> 00:54.650
of like a point value to it to determine what style rules should be applied.

00:54.650 --> 00:59.350
So for example to better explain this let's let's dive into an example here.

00:59.480 --> 01:05.940
So here we have a group of elements here right of elements selectors.

01:06.110 --> 01:13.520
Well what if we took an element selector here and we gave it the same property of a color.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.090
But we wanted something different.

01:16.350 --> 01:23.750
OK so in each one of these cases we've got a head or one selector element and the first one has a color

01:23.750 --> 01:26.690
of white and the second one has a color of green.

01:26.900 --> 01:30.630
So let's see which declaration is going to take precedence here.

01:30.950 --> 01:37.550
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to launch this and it looks like that the font color green took

01:37.550 --> 01:38.500
place right.

01:38.510 --> 01:45.260
So before we had the grouped elements and then the last one where we did the standalone header one tagged

01:45.560 --> 01:47.690
it took the president of green.

01:47.690 --> 01:48.810
Now why is that.

01:48.920 --> 01:54.390
Well it's because each of these elements selectors has a value of 1.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.380
So check out the calculator here.

01:57.560 --> 02:05.480
To the left and you'll see that an element selector has the least value of any of the other type of

02:05.480 --> 02:06.560
selectors.

02:06.560 --> 02:15.260
So when you have a declaration of equal value the one that comes last in your cascading style she is

02:15.260 --> 02:16.030
going to win.

02:16.310 --> 02:22.290
So for example let's cut this one and we'll put it right above here.

02:22.840 --> 02:23.480
OK.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.040
And then let's go ahead and check it out again.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.600
And now it's white.

02:27.740 --> 02:28.120
All right.

02:28.130 --> 02:36.020
And that's because the White had her one property value came last in ours Cascading Style Sheet.

02:36.020 --> 02:37.180
So it took precedence.

02:37.400 --> 02:44.380
All right so we know that if we add multiple selectors to the declaration we're making that it gets

02:44.390 --> 02:45.830
a higher point value.

02:45.830 --> 02:47.330
So what if.

02:47.330 --> 02:53.420
Right over here you see that we've got a DIV tag in our head or one tag is nested inside of it.

02:53.420 --> 02:59.450
What if we went ahead and grabbed the div selector and then our head or one and we know that the head

02:59.450 --> 03:06.070
of one is a descendant of the div tag here which means we've got this head or one that's inside of the

03:06.070 --> 03:06.670
Stiv tag.

03:06.680 --> 03:12.900
And then on the very outside here we actually have a head or one tag that's outside of it.

03:13.070 --> 03:20.450
So what this means is this is going to have a point value of two because we've got two elements with

03:20.450 --> 03:27.940
one point and then the one outside of our div element is going to inherit the color of white.

03:28.130 --> 03:30.150
So let me show you what that looks like.

03:32.610 --> 03:38.370
So you can see here that we've got the green now because we've got a higher point value and then the

03:38.610 --> 03:44.590
one element that was outside of our DIV tag just inherited the white color there.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.190
So let's come back to brackets.

03:47.190 --> 03:49.870
Now let's do another example this one is going to be fun.

03:49.920 --> 03:56.610
So go ahead and copy this class here and give it some space above and we're going to go ahead and paste

03:56.610 --> 03:57.030
it.

03:57.240 --> 04:03.230
And what I want you to do is on the top one I want you to change this to body.

04:03.690 --> 04:08.510
And then on this one here let's change it to aged himself.

04:08.890 --> 04:13.210
All right so and make the female red.

04:13.290 --> 04:14.210
All right cool.

04:14.460 --> 04:15.990
So let's look at this.

04:15.990 --> 04:19.440
So we've got two elements selectors on each.

04:19.440 --> 04:27.170
So we've got two points on these but if we come over to our HTL we've got this tag here.

04:27.240 --> 04:30.200
We're grabbing like the super parent right.

04:30.210 --> 04:36.870
Because the female is like the very very very top element of this entire page and we're saying every

04:36.950 --> 04:41.270
or one descendant of the HTML page make it a color red.

04:41.520 --> 04:46.790
But then if we dive a little deeper we've got this body tag in here and we're saying hey every head

04:46.790 --> 04:50.260
or one tag that is a descendant of the body.

04:50.310 --> 04:52.080
Go ahead and make it green.

04:52.110 --> 04:56.770
So which one's going to take precedence here which one's going to win.

04:56.790 --> 04:57.230
All right.

04:57.240 --> 05:02.850
So we've got the hierarchy of the male which is a top element and then we've got the body.

05:03.030 --> 05:10.200
So everybody pulls out some cash and everything dropped on the table let's make some bets and let's

05:10.200 --> 05:12.020
go ahead and check this out.

05:12.900 --> 05:13.950
And it's red.

05:14.130 --> 05:14.830
OK.

05:14.940 --> 05:22.290
Well that kind of makes sense because we assigned the red to our h team L right which in our H.M. page

05:22.290 --> 05:24.980
over here it's like the top element.

05:25.200 --> 05:31.600
But what happens if we take the and we cut it and we put it above the body.

05:31.980 --> 05:34.470
Are we still going to get the same result.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.660
And does anybody owe me money.

05:36.660 --> 05:38.660
Did you lose the bet.

05:38.670 --> 05:39.120
All right.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.590
So let's let's come back to the browser.

05:42.990 --> 05:44.990
And now we've got green.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.510
All right so it changed so it doesn't matter about the hierarchy in our shemale page over here.

05:51.540 --> 05:58.110
So looking at the calculator again we've got two H Jamail element selectors.

05:58.220 --> 05:58.800
OK.

05:58.860 --> 06:03.990
They both have a point value of 1 and there's two in here so there is a point value of two that are

06:04.050 --> 06:04.920
equal.

06:04.920 --> 06:12.590
However remember in a cascading style sheet the last one with the same points is going to win.

06:12.600 --> 06:17.550
So that's why the Green won here this last time around took precedence.

06:17.910 --> 06:25.020
Let's go ahead and do another example and change your T.M. classier and we're going to grab the container

06:25.020 --> 06:25.590
class.

06:25.610 --> 06:25.940
All right.

06:25.940 --> 06:29.120
And then on the body just go ahead and change your back to a div.

06:29.130 --> 06:36.380
So what we're saying here is every head or one tag that is a descendent of this container.

06:36.450 --> 06:41.970
We want it to be red and then we're also saying that every head or one there is a descendant of the

06:41.970 --> 06:42.700
div tag.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.250
We want it to be green.

06:44.370 --> 06:46.640
So they both have two selectors in here.

06:46.650 --> 06:48.280
But let's see which one wins.

06:48.630 --> 06:53.490
So come back over to the browser and you can see that our container class 1 right.

06:53.700 --> 06:55.570
Because we've got the text that is red.

06:55.590 --> 06:58.850
So let's go back to the text editor and find out why.

06:58.890 --> 07:06.420
So looking at our calculator here we can see that we get a point for having a class and we get a point

07:06.420 --> 07:10.270
for having an element and then down here we get a point for having an element.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.400
And we have another point for having an element.

07:13.410 --> 07:18.570
So over here we have 11 points which beats the two points down here.

07:18.570 --> 07:20.550
Making sense you're following.

07:20.940 --> 07:21.260
All right.

07:21.270 --> 07:23.630
So let's do something a little bit crazy here.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.600
And on this Hetter one tag.

07:26.910 --> 07:33.160
Go ahead and add an ID card and we're going to create this ID and equal it to foo.

07:33.270 --> 07:38.890
All right and then save that and then come over here let's add some space up top here.

07:38.970 --> 07:46.590
And what I want you to do is grab the element fill and then we're going to change this to a color of

07:46.660 --> 07:48.810
red.

07:48.810 --> 07:54.420
All right and then down here let's grab her I.D. in a different way.

07:54.420 --> 07:56.490
Let's use an attribute selector.

07:56.550 --> 08:05.010
So create some square brackets and then in here we're going to say every ID that is equal to foo we

08:05.010 --> 08:11.580
want this style property to have a color of kind.

08:11.620 --> 08:12.470
All right.

08:12.660 --> 08:18.660
So this is going to be interesting here because if we remember our calculator we're going to be adding

08:18.660 --> 08:20.090
up some points here.

08:20.370 --> 08:26.070
So we know that the IDs have a higher point value over our classes.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.420
But how is this going to work.

08:27.420 --> 08:29.160
Which one is going to win.

08:29.490 --> 08:31.420
Grabbing the idea two separate ways.

08:31.620 --> 08:33.930
Well let's go ahead and find out.

08:34.200 --> 08:45.070
So coming over to this hack you can see that our idea class or our idea selector is the one that one.

08:45.300 --> 08:46.210
And why is that.

08:46.230 --> 08:48.500
Well let's pull open the calculator.

08:48.720 --> 08:54.150
So looking at the calculator we get one point for having an ID.

08:54.360 --> 08:59.080
We don't have any classes in this and we don't have any elements so we get zero points.

08:59.220 --> 09:07.500
And then over here we actually get one point for having a class or an attribute right here because in

09:07.500 --> 09:14.210
here you can see that we have classes pseudo code and attributes right here.

09:14.340 --> 09:19.870
So we get a point for having an attribute selector and then there's no elements or anything else so

09:19.870 --> 09:20.830
we get a point zero.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.820
So we only got a point of 10 here.

09:23.880 --> 09:29.800
All right so now there is one more way that we can do this.

09:29.820 --> 09:35.200
And this is with a style property directly embedded inside of the Shanelle.

09:35.490 --> 09:38.840
So over here in our shemale create a space.

09:39.120 --> 09:44.310
And let's go ahead and type in style and then let's add a color.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.600
And we're going to make it different here.

09:46.710 --> 09:49.500
Let's make this one yellow.

09:49.740 --> 09:54.180
I mean lowercase them and then end it with the semi-colon.

09:54.180 --> 10:00.980
So now we have embedded a style color inside of our H-L element.

10:00.980 --> 10:02.350
This one.

10:02.370 --> 10:06.430
So let's check out how that works.

10:06.690 --> 10:14.940
And you can see that with the style property added directly into our age HTML that it gave us the most

10:14.940 --> 10:22.770
points so going back to our calculator you can see that we get one point for having a style attribute

10:22.800 --> 10:24.170
instead of an HMO.

10:24.510 --> 10:29.580
And we don't have any of the other ID's classes or elements we get zero points.

10:29.580 --> 10:33.340
So this in essence gave us a thousand points right.

10:33.540 --> 10:36.380
Whereas the ID was only giving us 100.

10:37.080 --> 10:42.590
But what if we got really really really specific with this idea over here.

10:42.870 --> 10:50.370
What if we just went crazy when we grabbed the HTML element and then the body and then the DIV tag with

10:50.370 --> 11:00.540
the class of container and then we went into the head or one tag with the with the idea of foo.

11:00.540 --> 11:03.920
Now that is pretty specific here isn't it.

11:03.930 --> 11:09.030
I mean if we're talking about specificity whatever that is.

11:09.030 --> 11:11.590
We were very specific and what we're working with.

11:11.580 --> 11:12.130
Right.

11:12.300 --> 11:21.380
So let's see which one is going to win our inline or our super specific selectors in here.

11:21.810 --> 11:26.050
And going to this we check it out and it's still yellow.

11:26.340 --> 11:27.620
And why is that.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.850
Well let's look at our calculator.

11:30.180 --> 11:35.000
Even though we're being very very specific here let's see what these points add up to.

11:35.250 --> 11:40.750
Well we get a point for having an element we get another point for having an unknown element.

11:40.920 --> 11:44.390
We get another point for the div element.

11:44.400 --> 11:54.300
We get a point for the class and we get a point for the head of one element and we get a point for the

11:54.300 --> 11:59.870
foo ID and that gives us a total score of 114.

12:00.090 --> 12:04.970
So 1000 still out beats a hundred and fourteen.

12:04.980 --> 12:08.190
So now there's one more thing that I want to cover in this.

12:08.190 --> 12:08.890
OK.

12:09.180 --> 12:12.810
And that is the important rule.

12:12.810 --> 12:19.510
Now technically important has nothing to do with it has nothing to do with it.

12:19.630 --> 12:20.290
All right.

12:20.470 --> 12:23.980
But it does affect how we use it.

12:24.040 --> 12:30.540
All right because it really overwrites the flow of our Cascading Style Sheet.

12:30.640 --> 12:34.650
And let me show you what I mean by that so we can come down here.

12:34.840 --> 12:40.650
And let's go ahead and just we're going to use this right here we're going to grab this one element

12:42.020 --> 12:43.810
All right let me create some space here.

12:44.010 --> 12:45.900
So we're going to grab this one element.

12:45.890 --> 12:46.560
All right.

12:46.680 --> 12:52.410
We've already got this inline styling over here of yellow that's just dominating everything.

12:52.410 --> 12:54.490
It has a thousand points.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.380
All right.

12:55.410 --> 13:01.350
But if we come to this one and we have a color of green which technically we only have a point value

13:01.350 --> 13:13.110
of one compared to 1000 here and we add this important rule this is going to override every single style

13:13.110 --> 13:16.660
rule that has been applied to this one.

13:16.680 --> 13:20.550
Now I highly recommend not using this.

13:20.550 --> 13:26.040
This is really going to mess up your cascading style sheet when you're trying to debug things because

13:26.130 --> 13:28.390
it is such a hard override on this.

13:28.410 --> 13:28.890
OK.

13:29.040 --> 13:35.850
So let's go check this out in the browser so you can see that it has completely overridden all style

13:35.850 --> 13:42.850
attributes regardless of the way that we've nested our head or one tag to target a color that important

13:42.870 --> 13:53.080
tag is going to dominate and completely nuke that point system only use important on page specific CSSA

13:53.100 --> 14:00.000
that overrides foreign s.c.s like external libraries such as bootstrap or unnormalized VSS.

14:00.060 --> 14:06.660
And really when it comes down to it just be specific for the element that you're trying to select and

14:06.660 --> 14:14.310
you can do that by adding additional elements selectors in front of the element you're targeting like

14:14.310 --> 14:16.950
we did here when we were trying to target the head of one.

14:16.950 --> 14:20.350
We added a bunch of selectors in front of it.

14:20.520 --> 14:25.410
And if you find yourself in situations where you're having conflicting style rules go ahead and use

14:25.770 --> 14:32.110
the specificity point template that I have provided add things up and see where the problem is.

14:32.130 --> 14:36.620
That wraps it up for this lesson with CSSA specificity.

14:36.930 --> 14:37.910
We'll see you then.

14:40.990 --> 14:48.050
This specific city and I'll say it in slow motion so you understand what I'm saying.

14:48.310 --> 14:50.240
It's space.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.600
Mark what is it.

14:53.140 --> 15:01.620
A better use of spaces specificity specificity versus specificity specif specificity.

15:01.670 --> 15:07.260
I can't remember what Mark told me do this word for.
