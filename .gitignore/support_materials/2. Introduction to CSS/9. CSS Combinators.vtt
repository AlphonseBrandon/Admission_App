00:04.790 --> 00:05.820
The

00:08.950 --> 00:14.120
A What's up everybody this is Jason with Dev slopes dot com and in this video we are going to learn

00:14.150 --> 00:20.510
about CSSA combinations using descendant and child selectors and the difference between them.

00:20.510 --> 00:22.680
All right so let's go ahead and get started.

00:22.700 --> 00:27.700
So real quick go ahead and grab this image here and we're just going to cut it.

00:27.740 --> 00:32.920
And we want to go ahead and place it in our container because that makes sense to keep everything contained.

00:33.140 --> 00:37.910
And for this example we are going to create an unordered list.

00:37.910 --> 00:40.030
So go ahead right beneath the image.

00:40.250 --> 00:44.620
Let's create an unordered list and then we're going to put some list items in here.

00:44.780 --> 00:50.440
And the first list item we're going to write I love to skate.

00:50.500 --> 00:51.020
All right.

00:51.050 --> 01:02.920
And then the second list item let's put my favorite skate tricks are right.

01:02.940 --> 01:08.400
And then now let's list some favorite tricks and in here we're going to put in an ordered list.

01:08.400 --> 01:15.480
We're going to nest some list items here and let me get inside here.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.840
Create a list item.

01:17.010 --> 01:20.130
And I love 360 flips.

01:20.130 --> 01:21.470
Those are fun.

01:21.900 --> 01:29.500
And then another really cool trick that I love is back side nose blunts.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.150
OK.

01:31.230 --> 01:31.570
All right.

01:31.590 --> 01:32.770
You don't know what they are look them up.

01:32.770 --> 01:34.520
They're fun fun tricks.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.180
And then so we've got our nested ordered list.

01:38.220 --> 01:44.910
And then right outside of that let's create our last list item which is going to be a third list item

01:44.910 --> 01:52.130
to our unordered list and we'll put skate till you can't walk.

01:52.210 --> 01:56.780
All right and yes that's improper grammar but it sounds better.

01:56.780 --> 01:57.310
All right.

01:57.330 --> 01:57.950
I love it.

01:57.950 --> 02:01.790
So let's go ahead and see how this looks.

02:01.800 --> 02:05.970
It's probably going to be a little bit difficult to see because we got a dark background and it's going

02:05.970 --> 02:09.260
to be black text on it and it is.

02:09.270 --> 02:10.900
But we can kind of see it here.

02:11.340 --> 02:17.220
Let's go ahead and work with some descendants and learn what that is.

02:17.460 --> 02:26.310
So over in our CSSA let's grab the unordered lists or Graben this element here and then put a space

02:26.350 --> 02:34.410
and grab a list item and then open that up with some curly braces so what a descendant selector is is

02:34.620 --> 02:37.470
we have a parent and then a child.

02:37.470 --> 02:44.410
And what we're saying is every single list item under an unordered list.

02:44.580 --> 02:49.560
We're going to add these style rules to it and it doesn't matter how deep this is.

02:49.560 --> 02:53.340
So we've got a top level here and then we've got a nested level here.

02:53.340 --> 02:59.340
So when we go ahead and add a color and I'm going to add white.

02:59.340 --> 03:01.020
So it shows up better.

03:01.140 --> 03:06.250
And then we do a font size of like 20 pixels.

03:06.780 --> 03:14.130
What we're saying is with this an ordered list these lists items and the nested list items in this ordered

03:14.130 --> 03:20.830
list are going to take on the color and the font size that we've set here.

03:20.840 --> 03:21.210
All right.

03:21.210 --> 03:25.680
And this could be 50 levels deep 50 nests.

03:25.680 --> 03:33.480
All right if that makes sense 50 nests it's going to inherit this property so let's come over here and

03:33.480 --> 03:40.740
refresh and we can see that we have added a white color and a font size of 20 pixels.

03:40.740 --> 03:47.790
Now let's learn the difference between descendants and then child selectors.

03:47.790 --> 03:48.140
All right.

03:48.150 --> 03:54.030
So let's come back over to brackets and what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the unordered list

03:54.030 --> 03:59.910
again and this time I am going to target the list item.

04:00.060 --> 04:08.310
And what this says is when we use this selector is we are saying that anything any unordered list that

04:08.310 --> 04:15.350
has a child that is a list item here that is only one level deep.

04:15.450 --> 04:17.290
Inherit these style rules.

04:17.430 --> 04:18.200
OK.

04:18.390 --> 04:21.150
So it only goes one level deep.

04:21.150 --> 04:30.870
So if we went ahead and we added a color of yellow All right that means that these lists items over

04:30.870 --> 04:41.310
here are going to inherit the white because the direct children of this unordered list which is these

04:41.310 --> 04:44.670
three are going to inherit the color yellow.

04:44.670 --> 04:45.940
Me show you what that looks like.

04:47.280 --> 04:50.240
And there you have it you can see it's yellow.

04:50.280 --> 04:58.590
So we had our unordered list here and we have three immediate child elements list items here which inherited

04:58.590 --> 04:59.930
the color yellow.

05:00.090 --> 05:06.870
But then we had these nested list items in an ordered list that didn't get targeted.

05:06.870 --> 05:13.090
It just inherited the standard unordered list style rules that we had applied to it.

05:13.140 --> 05:20.540
So very simple stuff that is CSSA combinations using descendants and child selectors.

05:20.550 --> 05:22.200
And the difference between them.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.140
Let's move on.
