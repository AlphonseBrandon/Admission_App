WEBVTT

00:04.790 --> 00:05.830
The

00:08.570 --> 00:11.750
hey what's up everybody this is Jason with death slopes dot com.

00:11.750 --> 00:15.710
And in this video we are going to learn about CSSA coloreds.

00:15.800 --> 00:21.710
Now there's one of three ways that we can use colors in our projects and I'm going to take you through

00:21.710 --> 00:23.410
and show you how to do that.

00:23.420 --> 00:29.330
So first thing in your index file Let's go ahead and create two elements here.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.100
The first one we're going to create is a Hetter one tag.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.190
And we'll just write.

00:34.280 --> 00:38.840
You are CSSA to my HMO.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.050
All right.

00:40.130 --> 00:47.570
And then the second element we're going to create is a header or two tag and we'll just try any one

00:47.840 --> 00:50.330
skate out there.

00:50.810 --> 00:51.580
All right sweet.

00:51.620 --> 00:58.790
So now we've got two elements on our page that we can work with so I'm going to go ahead and do a vertical

00:58.790 --> 01:00.330
split view here.

01:00.710 --> 01:10.220
Now next why don't we go ahead and create a DIV tag with a class of container and just wrap these header

01:10.250 --> 01:11.390
tags in that.

01:11.390 --> 01:12.270
All right.

01:12.740 --> 01:16.380
And then right below here we can go ahead and paste them.

01:16.430 --> 01:17.660
All right perfect.

01:17.660 --> 01:21.950
So now we've got a class that we can work with and then two header elements.

01:21.950 --> 01:22.480
All right.

01:22.610 --> 01:26.860
So let's go ahead and add a color to this container.

01:26.870 --> 01:27.590
All right.

01:27.590 --> 01:34.430
So to do that we're simply going to grab our class container and then we're going to add a background

01:35.030 --> 01:36.000
color to this.

01:36.100 --> 01:36.810
All right.

01:38.640 --> 01:44.520
And what we're going to do first is the first way that we can add a color here is by writing the specific

01:44.520 --> 01:45.750
name of a color.

01:45.750 --> 01:46.340
OK.

01:46.380 --> 01:52.230
Now when you're writing the name of the color one thing to know is the color name actually has to exist.

01:52.260 --> 01:55.310
You can't just like make up a color name and throw it in there.

01:55.380 --> 01:58.550
You have to make sure that the current name actually exists.

01:58.560 --> 02:01.650
And in this case we are going to use.

02:02.160 --> 02:05.000
Let's go ahead and use this dark slate blue.

02:05.220 --> 02:06.730
All right.

02:07.440 --> 02:11.010
So close that off with a semi there and then.

02:11.040 --> 02:19.450
Let's go ahead and launch this and see what it looks like Cool so you can see that we've got a background

02:19.450 --> 02:24.710
color that we've added to this container and we've got our two header tags wrapped inside of this.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.320
Let's go over a second way that we can use colors in CSSA and to do this let's go ahead and grab the

02:32.320 --> 02:36.730
head or one tag right and right color.

02:36.730 --> 02:44.140
So to add a color to a any type of a text or a font you're going to write the property color and then

02:44.140 --> 02:46.740
in this case let's use a hex code.

02:46.870 --> 02:57.250
Now a hex code begins with a pound signed and then you can either use three or six characters depending

02:57.310 --> 02:59.980
on the color that you're using.

02:59.980 --> 03:05.680
Now if you're using one of the like primary colors like black or white or red or blue something like

03:05.680 --> 03:11.230
that you can get away with using three letters in your hex code.

03:11.230 --> 03:19.130
But if you want more of a specific color of some sort you can use up to six hex code letters here.

03:19.180 --> 03:22.150
So this is the hex code for white.

03:22.510 --> 03:23.860
I've added 6 F's here.

03:23.860 --> 03:29.520
Now I could add three but I'm just going to use 6 and then if we come back over to this and refresh

03:29.520 --> 03:35.240
or you can see that we have change the color to the head of one font to white.

03:35.290 --> 03:35.800
Awesome.

03:35.800 --> 03:40.060
So pretty standard and there is a third way that we can do this.

03:40.090 --> 03:46.360
And let's go ahead and grab our head or two and we're going to add the same color property because we're

03:46.360 --> 03:48.360
working with tex.

03:48.460 --> 03:51.890
And then this one is an R.G. B color here.

03:52.090 --> 03:53.580
OK so you're simply going to write.

03:53.610 --> 04:01.360
RG double parentheses and then close it off with the semi colon and then in here we're going to give

04:01.360 --> 04:05.560
this three values and I'm going to make this a blue color.

04:05.590 --> 04:10.010
And so we're going to go ahead and out our three values so I'm going to add a zero.

04:10.090 --> 04:16.750
It needs to be followed by a comma and then it's two or four followed by a comma and then 255 K..

04:16.900 --> 04:19.210
And this is going to give us a blue color.

04:19.570 --> 04:26.120
So when we're using R.G. B's colors remember takes three values and then it's separated by a comma.

04:26.290 --> 04:31.880
And again this allows us to get more of a specific color that we're looking for.

04:32.020 --> 04:38.620
If like the name of a color isn't giving us what we're looking for so let's go ahead and save that and

04:38.620 --> 04:43.980
come back over here and you can see that we have changed the color of our head or two.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.400
So very cool stuff.

04:45.400 --> 04:49.140
Those are the three ways that you can use colors.

04:49.150 --> 04:53.860
Now let's dive a little bit deeper and show you how we can work with gradients.

04:53.950 --> 04:54.690
All right.

04:54.850 --> 05:04.480
So to do this on this container Let's go ahead and get rid of the background color and put a semi colon.

05:04.480 --> 05:10.180
And we're just going to be working with a background and then let's go ahead and open up our browser

05:11.290 --> 05:17.680
and we're going to dive in a little bit deeper and have a better understanding of CSSA gradients.

05:17.710 --> 05:23.660
So go ahead and type in CSSA gradient and then let's come to W3 schools here.

05:25.990 --> 05:31.210
All right so it says here that says three gradients that you display smooth transitions between two

05:31.210 --> 05:33.130
or more specified colors.

05:33.130 --> 05:34.120
All right.

05:34.120 --> 05:39.310
And you can see here in their example they kind of got this greenish blue over to a darker blue.

05:39.310 --> 05:47.210
And also one thing to note with gradients is not all browsers support this like all browser versions

05:47.290 --> 05:54.010
and there is an extra syntax that we can add to our gradients to help browsers pick up on this.

05:54.010 --> 06:03.010
So for a gradient we can either use a linear gradient radial a repeating or a repeating radial gradient.

06:03.040 --> 06:06.710
And these are the different browsers and there compatibility.

06:06.790 --> 06:12.600
Now you'll notice that they have a syntax here like a Web Kit and then the Mozilla.

06:12.610 --> 06:13.110
Here.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.160
And then the O for Oprah.

06:15.160 --> 06:24.400
So using this syntax here will help the browser read the property value of this linear gradient so it

06:24.400 --> 06:25.390
shows up.

06:25.450 --> 06:30.790
So coming down here a little bit further we've got some examples how we can use this so you can see

06:30.790 --> 06:36.610
that they're using an ID and they're using the property background and then they're able to set these

06:36.610 --> 06:37.890
gradients.

06:37.910 --> 06:45.670
Now you do want to have a fallback default color for the browser to fall back on just in case there

06:45.730 --> 06:49.180
is a compatibility issue for the browser.

06:49.300 --> 06:52.650
So that way it just reads a standard color and I'm going to pull something in.

06:52.810 --> 07:00.160
And then you can see that they have four other ways of adding the gradients and that's just adding in

07:00.160 --> 07:04.920
a Web Kit compatibility for Oprah and Firefox.

07:05.020 --> 07:08.130
And then they have the standard text here at the bottom.

07:08.170 --> 07:11.160
So let's come back into brackets here.

07:12.230 --> 07:18.470
And then on this what we're going to do is because we're using Chrome here and Chrome is very compatible

07:18.470 --> 07:21.100
with a lot of the standards out there.

07:21.140 --> 07:24.380
We're simply going to write a linear gradient.

07:24.380 --> 07:30.620
This is the gradient that we're going to use in this example and then put your parentheses and then

07:30.620 --> 07:38.140
close that off and then this is going to be taking a starting point and an end point.

07:38.140 --> 07:39.110
All right.

07:39.110 --> 07:41.420
So let's go ahead and grab two colors here.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.260
I'm actually going to come back over to the browser.

07:44.570 --> 07:50.660
I'm going to open up a new tab here and just write in html color picker.

07:50.660 --> 07:55.130
And then again W3 schools has a really cool one that I like to use and the color that we're going to

07:55.130 --> 07:57.720
be using is this blue here.

07:58.100 --> 08:02.330
So I'm going to grab this hex value here.

08:02.540 --> 08:07.060
I'm going to come back over the brackets and this is going to be my starting color.

08:07.160 --> 08:14.090
OK so I'm going to go ahead and paste that in and then it takes two values because now I need the stopping

08:14.750 --> 08:21.620
end of the color and I'm going to come back over to this and list to choose a lighter blue and I'm going

08:21.620 --> 08:27.150
to grab this one here and copy it and then we'll come back over here and paste that color in.

08:27.410 --> 08:28.160
All right.

08:28.160 --> 08:32.330
And then let's go ahead and change this to a no split view because we're going to be working directly

08:32.330 --> 08:33.540
in our CSSA here.

08:33.800 --> 08:37.850
So now what we've done is we've added a linear gradient.

08:37.870 --> 08:38.220
OK.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.760
And this is a top to bottom.

08:41.060 --> 08:49.100
So back into our browser here and you can see that it's taken the darker color added it to the top and

08:49.100 --> 08:52.760
then it fades very smoothly into our lighter blue.

08:52.760 --> 08:56.790
Now you saw that there was radial gradients and so forth.

08:56.840 --> 09:03.530
We can also take these linear gradients and we can control the starting and stopping point of it and

09:03.530 --> 09:04.620
to do that.

09:04.700 --> 09:09.080
For example we can add a third variable here.

09:09.770 --> 09:16.820
And what we can do is for an example we can say to right and this way it's going to start it from the

09:16.820 --> 09:18.350
right to left.

09:18.440 --> 09:24.980
OK so back over here and you can see now we've got a blue starting from the right and going to the left.

09:24.980 --> 09:32.330
And you can do the same thing to the left and then you can also define like top or bottom.

09:32.540 --> 09:33.010
Right.

09:33.020 --> 09:39.740
So I'm not going to go ahead and I'm not going to add the web kits and the syntax for the other browsers

09:39.830 --> 09:42.970
in this example we're just going to stick with a basic here.

09:42.980 --> 09:46.930
So that is how you can work with gradients.

09:46.940 --> 09:53.120
So it's just a background property and then choose the type of gradient you want to use and then you

09:53.120 --> 09:57.790
can choose a direction and a starting and stopping color there.

09:57.800 --> 09:58.400
All right.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.020
All right.

10:00.020 --> 10:02.270
Now the last thing that I want to cover here.

10:02.420 --> 10:10.220
Working with colors is shadows and shadows are cool you can apply those to like backgrounds or text

10:10.610 --> 10:14.140
or images really add any element on your page.

10:14.180 --> 10:20.810
So let's come down to the hetter one tag and to add a shadow to a font.

10:20.930 --> 10:30.230
Go ahead and type in tex shadow and then it's going to take two to three values here and in this first

10:30.230 --> 10:34.510
example we're just going right to pixels by two pixels.

10:34.790 --> 10:39.200
And what this is doing is we have our elements selected here.

10:39.230 --> 10:47.690
K our element is selected and then we're saying on a vertical access where do we want our shadow to

10:47.690 --> 10:49.990
be placed like how far out.

10:50.180 --> 10:53.890
And then how far out do you want it placed on a horizontal access.

10:54.120 --> 10:54.670
OK.

10:54.710 --> 11:00.590
So go ahead and save that and we're setting the vertical and horizontal axis to two pixels by two pixels.

11:00.590 --> 11:06.080
All right and that's going to put it to the bottom right now if we were to do negative 2 pixels and

11:06.080 --> 11:10.720
negative 2 pixels This would put it at the top left.

11:10.730 --> 11:16.080
So coming into here you can see that it has added a shadow back here.

11:16.080 --> 11:24.090
It's it's difficult to see because we've added a white text color to our font so that's what it's inheriting.

11:24.110 --> 11:26.370
So why don't we go ahead and change that.

11:26.750 --> 11:31.170
So right after the two pixels we can actually define a color that we want to add to this.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.760
And in this case let's use black.

11:33.890 --> 11:36.690
That will show up really well with our white font.

11:36.740 --> 11:38.650
So go ahead and save that.

11:39.020 --> 11:42.510
And now you can see that it's taken our shadow.

11:42.620 --> 11:45.940
And it's it's a solid black color.

11:45.950 --> 11:52.610
Now the cool thing is we can actually add one more variable to this to this property here and that's

11:52.610 --> 11:58.310
called a blur radius so instead of having such a hard black we can kind of spread the sound and blur

11:58.310 --> 11:58.780
it out.

11:58.790 --> 12:01.820
So let me show you how that works.

12:01.820 --> 12:08.990
So right before defining your color black Let's go ahead and add a nother value here and we'll just

12:08.990 --> 12:17.330
do five pixels and this is going to take this solid black line and it's going to blurt it out 5 pixels.

12:18.620 --> 12:24.430
OK so coming into here you can see how much softer This is looking so very very clean.

12:24.640 --> 12:30.890
Let's go ahead and add a background shadow to our head or two.

12:30.910 --> 12:38.170
So again to do this we're going to do a text shadow and then in this case why don't we just do this

12:38.170 --> 12:41.210
like one pixel by one pixel.

12:41.320 --> 12:48.550
Give it a blur radius of like three pixels and then let's do a really cool color like hey let's just

12:48.550 --> 12:49.650
too dark blue.

12:49.990 --> 12:51.170
OK.

12:52.110 --> 12:54.660
All right and then let's check out how that looks.

12:55.090 --> 12:55.450
All right.

12:55.450 --> 13:00.010
And you can see that it's added a much finer tech shadow to this.

13:00.010 --> 13:08.400
Now we can also go ahead and actually add background shadow to this container that we've created.

13:08.770 --> 13:15.620
So if we come into here and then on our container add a box shadow OK.

13:15.700 --> 13:22.670
And then the same principle we can define the vertical horizontal axis set of Blur radius and a color.

13:22.690 --> 13:30.670
So let's just do like a three pixel by three where we can actually make this different by five pixel

13:31.090 --> 13:35.020
and then give it like a 3 pixel of a blur radius and then let's just do this as black.

13:35.020 --> 13:40.870
So it shows up easily and then come over here refresh that.

13:41.080 --> 13:47.260
And you can see that we've only shoved it over to pixels to the right but we've got a much heavier shadow

13:47.260 --> 13:48.610
here on the bottom.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.260
All right so very cool stuff.

13:50.260 --> 13:53.250
So that is how we work with colors.

13:53.350 --> 13:57.160
We can either use color names hex values or R.G. colors.

13:57.160 --> 14:04.630
We've used colored gradients in here and then we have also learned how to add shadows to Tex or other

14:04.630 --> 14:06.880
elements on our page so very cool stuff.

14:06.880 --> 14:07.480
That's it.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.750
That is a wrap.

14:08.750 --> 14:09.580
Moving on.
