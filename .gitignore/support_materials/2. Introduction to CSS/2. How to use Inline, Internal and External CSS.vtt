00:08.960 --> 00:12.510
Hey What's up everybody this is Jason with Def slips dot com.

00:12.650 --> 00:17.720
And today I'm going to show you three ways that you can set up success in your project.

00:17.720 --> 00:21.440
So let's let's start a new project if you're using brackets.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.260
Go ahead do the drop down.

00:23.480 --> 00:26.830
And I'm going to just throw this on my desktop.

00:26.890 --> 00:27.510
OK.

00:27.710 --> 00:32.780
I'm going to call this learned C Ss and we're going to open this up.

00:32.780 --> 00:36.100
So now we've got a blank project to start with.

00:36.380 --> 00:45.410
Right click on the left hand nav bar here click new file and then create an index die aged him now.

00:45.620 --> 00:46.660
All right cool.

00:46.700 --> 00:49.480
So we're going to write this from the ground up.

00:49.730 --> 00:55.100
So go ahead and write in the doc type H.T. mail.

00:55.190 --> 01:01.630
This is a good practice that helps the browser identify your website as in each HTML file.

01:01.880 --> 01:04.880
And then let's create the Tamil body here.

01:05.060 --> 01:07.430
And this is another good practice set.

01:07.430 --> 01:11.240
Set the language to your age T.M. Web site.

01:11.240 --> 01:14.880
This way the browser knows what default language to load it in.

01:15.020 --> 01:20.360
And then let's go ahead and create the head of our age HTML file and inside the head we're going to

01:20.360 --> 01:21.510
create a title.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.240
So learn see.

01:24.450 --> 01:25.030
All right cool.

01:25.130 --> 01:32.050
So that's all we're going to put into the head and then we need a body for HTML file right.

01:32.060 --> 01:34.450
Everything needs a body.

01:35.750 --> 01:36.250
Cool.

01:36.350 --> 01:37.660
So that's great.

01:37.670 --> 01:40.630
All right so we've got everything set up here.

01:40.760 --> 01:47.020
So what are the three ways that we can you know put success into our project.

01:47.330 --> 01:52.400
Well to learn how to do that let's just create a basic head or one tag.

01:52.790 --> 01:56.990
I'm going to take you through a few quick examples.

01:59.240 --> 01:59.710
OK.

01:59.740 --> 02:08.690
So we're going to do one a one called let's see ice cream and then a head or two that says I love CSX.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.080
All right cool.

02:10.100 --> 02:13.490
Now if you're using brackets go ahead and hit the thumb report here.

02:13.490 --> 02:18.140
This is going to pull up a preview of everything that we're doing here so you can see that I've got

02:18.140 --> 02:20.550
a head of one and a head or two.

02:20.780 --> 02:21.230
All right.

02:21.230 --> 02:22.810
And I'm going to hit command tab.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.910
It switches me back to brackets OK.

02:24.920 --> 02:29.510
So that's what I'm going to be doing to toggle between the two.

02:29.510 --> 02:38.630
All right so one way to add success to your elements in your web site is called inline styling and to

02:38.630 --> 02:44.720
do that you're literally going to come inside the element and add the styling.

02:44.750 --> 02:52.100
And to do that you would write style equals double quotes and we're going to grab the color property

02:52.190 --> 02:57.620
and assign it to let's do let's do red.

02:57.630 --> 03:03.050
Now I'm typing out red because I can't remember the hex code for red and you can do that sometimes but

03:03.050 --> 03:07.060
remember I said I like to use hex code hex codes.

03:07.070 --> 03:12.590
All right so let's check this out again and you can see that it changed the font.

03:12.590 --> 03:17.510
Now let's go ahead and change this one style.

03:17.660 --> 03:25.710
Let's do the color equals green K and end it with a semicolon.

03:26.150 --> 03:26.940
OK.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.110
Refresh that and check that out so it's change it to green.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.630
So that's one way.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.280
Now let's go ahead and add another style.

03:34.310 --> 03:42.470
So let's add a border and then you hit a semi-colon and let's do this one pixel which determines the

03:42.470 --> 03:47.360
thickness will make it thicker so you can see three pixels.

03:47.360 --> 03:58.170
And then you can define a solid and then the color of it which will do Blue K and it added a solid three

03:58.170 --> 03:59.960
pixel blue border.

04:00.480 --> 04:07.380
And you can even change this to dotted this is just some fun stuff you can do with borders to change

04:07.380 --> 04:08.350
it up a little bit.

04:08.760 --> 04:09.250
OK.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.900
So there's that.

04:10.950 --> 04:19.650
Now you can imagine that if I'm building an entire Web site and I'm doing everything inline styles that

04:19.650 --> 04:24.070
my web site is probably going to start looking really really really messy.

04:24.330 --> 04:30.300
And another thing what if I had a bunch of header tags from my web site and I want to change them all

04:30.300 --> 04:38.010
from red to purple I'm going to go have to select every header one element and change the color on every

04:38.010 --> 04:39.130
single one of those.

04:39.180 --> 04:42.660
So inline styling is something you can do.

04:42.690 --> 04:44.680
I don't recommend it.

04:44.760 --> 04:51.840
So that's one way that you can add success to your project came inline styling.

04:51.840 --> 04:56.390
Now the second way you can do this is within the head.

04:56.550 --> 05:02.670
You can actually add internal stylesheet.

05:02.880 --> 05:08.500
And so what we would do here is would go ahead and grab the header one tag.

05:08.760 --> 05:09.270
OK.

05:09.390 --> 05:10.580
I did something wrong.

05:10.590 --> 05:11.630
I spelled it wrong.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.900
That's why this isn't working.

05:14.160 --> 05:14.500
All right.

05:14.520 --> 05:19.060
So you can grab the head or one tag and then you're going to make some curly brackets.

05:19.120 --> 05:19.790
OK.

05:19.890 --> 05:23.130
And then we can assign the color to be purple.

05:23.320 --> 05:23.990
OK.

05:24.630 --> 05:33.000
So if we come back here and you can see that's purple and if we wanted to grab the head or two element

05:33.000 --> 05:35.900
we could add the color to be.

05:36.090 --> 05:37.910
I don't know yellow.

05:38.580 --> 05:39.400
Ok cool.

05:39.420 --> 05:39.950
Wow.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.770
You can't even see that let's change the color.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.700
Let's see turquoise.

05:44.700 --> 05:46.020
That's a cool color.

05:46.020 --> 05:46.580
All right cool.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.790
That's better.

05:47.790 --> 05:49.440
So you can do things like that.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.390
OK.

05:50.490 --> 05:58.520
You can go ahead and add a background of what goes good with purple yellow background might go good.

05:59.340 --> 06:00.090
OK.

06:00.150 --> 06:02.880
And there is a yellow background.

06:02.880 --> 06:09.580
So that's some basic examples of how you can do internal styling.

06:10.110 --> 06:14.480
Again you can imagine if you're building this big web site.

06:14.490 --> 06:19.930
This file is going to get pretty long as you had different classes and everything right.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.110
It's going to get really big again.

06:22.290 --> 06:24.010
You can do this.

06:24.180 --> 06:25.750
I don't recommend it.

06:26.100 --> 06:26.420
All right.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.360
Now the third way.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.080
This is the way that I recommend.

06:29.220 --> 06:29.700
All right.

06:29.700 --> 06:37.440
So the third way of doing this is adding an external style sheet cam and the way that you do that is

06:37.810 --> 06:43.920
you're going to create a specific CSSA file so we can right click on the left hand side here click new

06:43.920 --> 06:51.690
file and I'm going to call the style CSSA has to you have to have the CSSA at the end to identify the

06:51.690 --> 06:53.750
file as a stylesheet.

06:54.090 --> 06:54.960
Ok cool.

06:54.960 --> 07:01.890
So now we've got a style sheet here but we need our Jamail page two to communicate with the style sheet

07:01.890 --> 07:08.190
we've got to link it so that we can pull in the styles from the external file into our HDL file.

07:08.220 --> 07:08.570
All right.

07:08.580 --> 07:13.580
And to do them inside the head we're going to add this link.

07:13.620 --> 07:20.290
We're going to link Persius as filed here and the relationship which is real is a style sheet.

07:20.480 --> 07:21.050
OK.

07:21.270 --> 07:28.950
And then to linkit This is like the u r l or the file path to our stylesheet.

07:29.040 --> 07:32.910
You can see that it's bringing it up already forming styles.

07:32.940 --> 07:35.380
Yes s and close it off there.

07:35.610 --> 07:42.960
So now with this with this line we have just pulled in our CSSA file and this has to be put inside the

07:42.960 --> 07:43.300
head.

07:43.350 --> 07:44.190
OK.

07:44.640 --> 07:45.530
All right cool.

07:45.630 --> 07:54.390
So now we can come over to here type in a header one for example and do a color.

07:54.660 --> 07:56.950
What colors do we have here.

07:57.180 --> 07:58.150
Let's do it.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.370
This kind of fluorescent green.

08:00.570 --> 08:06.910
And then we can grab our head or two element and assign it a color.

08:07.950 --> 08:10.160
Let's pick something fancy.

08:10.290 --> 08:13.010
Coral coral is cool.

08:13.010 --> 08:13.470
All right.

08:13.530 --> 08:19.480
And then we can switch it up here and we've got our green and our coral color.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.420
So you know it's working pretty cool right.

08:22.650 --> 08:28.360
So those are the three ways you can add CSSA to your project.

08:29.070 --> 08:35.730
And for this for this entire course the section we're going to be using an external stylesheet.

08:35.880 --> 08:36.600
So cool.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.620
We've got the template here.

08:37.620 --> 08:44.430
Go ahead and delete the styling in there and we can delete this example stuff here.

08:44.640 --> 08:45.410
So that's it.

08:45.410 --> 08:47.710
That's a wrap for this lesson.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.470
Let's move on.
