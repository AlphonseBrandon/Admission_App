00:04.790 --> 00:05.820
The

00:09.170 --> 00:14.930
What's up everybody this is Jason with Dev slopes dot com and in this video we are going to learn how

00:14.930 --> 00:18.020
to style different elements in our html page.

00:18.020 --> 00:18.640
All right.

00:18.830 --> 00:22.720
So there's three methods that we can use to accomplish this.

00:22.730 --> 00:26.110
The first one is we can directly target the element.

00:26.110 --> 00:26.850
All right.

00:26.990 --> 00:33.500
The second we can grab it by the class or third we can add an ID to it.

00:33.530 --> 00:37.850
Now the first thing we're going to learn is how to directly target an element.

00:37.850 --> 00:42.780
So if you look in our team here we've got a body tag.

00:42.890 --> 00:43.220
All right.

00:43.220 --> 00:47.120
So within the body tag is where all of our content lives.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.670
This is a direct element here.

00:48.710 --> 00:53.410
If I was to go below it and simply add a header tag here.

00:53.780 --> 00:56.420
This is going to be another specific element.

00:56.420 --> 01:00.370
So let me show you how we can directly target these.

01:00.380 --> 01:03.500
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a vertical split here.

01:03.710 --> 01:10.620
That way we have the HTML on the left and the SS on the right and we are going to directly target the

01:10.670 --> 01:11.410
element.

01:11.420 --> 01:11.830
All right.

01:11.830 --> 01:18.440
So come over here into your SS And what we're going to do to target this direct body tag is first we're

01:18.440 --> 01:20.330
going to write the word body.

01:20.440 --> 01:20.810
All right.

01:20.810 --> 01:25.780
Just by writing that we have now grab that specific element.

01:25.790 --> 01:31.920
Now after this create some curly braces and go ahead and press enter our right to open that up.

01:31.970 --> 01:38.820
Now inside of this this is where we can declare our styling properties for this specific body tag.

01:38.870 --> 01:39.450
All right.

01:39.620 --> 01:42.200
So let me show you how the syntax works on this.

01:42.200 --> 01:49.550
So in this first part here we're going to write the property K and we're going to be adding a background

01:49.550 --> 01:52.670
color to this body here.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.600
And then on the right side of this we're going to put the value are right and you can see two separate.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.870
This first we're going to add a colon.

02:01.930 --> 02:04.530
All right and then add a space and then we're going to put the value in.

02:04.550 --> 02:08.190
And right now I'm going to put in a hex code for a color.

02:08.210 --> 02:08.800
All right.

02:08.990 --> 02:14.990
Let me grab this color over here and I'm just going to paste it right here and I'm going to close it

02:14.990 --> 02:16.630
off with a semi-colon.

02:16.640 --> 02:17.220
All right.

02:17.330 --> 02:24.030
So we've directly grabbed the element we've created some curly braces on the left side of this.

02:24.080 --> 02:27.530
We have got the property we're separating it by a colon.

02:27.620 --> 02:31.880
And then we've added the value which in this case is going to be a color.

02:31.910 --> 02:32.300
All right.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.610
And I'm going to go ahead and save that.

02:34.820 --> 02:41.720
So go back to your HTML file and then let's go ahead and launch this so we can preview it.

02:42.230 --> 02:47.460
So as you can see we've added this very very soft purple color to the background.

02:47.630 --> 02:52.540
All right so in this case we directly targeted the body element.

02:52.550 --> 02:57.450
All right come back over to brackets and let's play with this head Hetter one tag right here.

02:57.470 --> 03:03.050
So in the head or tag let's just write anything you want I'm going to write.

03:03.050 --> 03:06.090
Skateboarding is awesome.

03:06.140 --> 03:06.640
OK.

03:06.770 --> 03:07.820
Perfect.

03:07.820 --> 03:12.800
So we've got a header tag and we're going to go and do the same exact thing that we did with the body

03:12.800 --> 03:13.420
tag.

03:13.760 --> 03:18.990
So to grab the head or tag it simply going to be H-1 create your curly braces.

03:19.010 --> 03:19.920
Open it up.

03:20.060 --> 03:23.960
And in this case let's change the font color.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.590
So we're going to go.

03:25.850 --> 03:30.830
Actually we're just typing in color and then we can add whatever color we want to this.

03:30.830 --> 03:33.950
And I'm just going to type in red.

03:33.950 --> 03:39.490
All right you see there's a different couple of different ways that we can use colors in CSSA.

03:39.650 --> 03:45.290
So what I've done here is I've grabbed the head of one element and I've given it a property and the

03:45.290 --> 03:46.740
value of red.

03:47.060 --> 03:52.310
So I'm going to go ahead and save that from back to my preview here.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.340
And you can see that I've added this text right here in the center.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.460
Pretty awesome.

03:57.470 --> 03:58.310
All right.

03:58.310 --> 04:00.880
So let's let's do another thing here.

04:00.920 --> 04:05.660
So we're learning how to directly target these elements and we know that we can add these properties

04:05.660 --> 04:06.840
and values in here.

04:07.040 --> 04:12.370
You can actually assign multiple styling properties to a single element.

04:12.440 --> 04:13.350
And here's how you do that.

04:13.350 --> 04:21.500
So right after the semi colon in our head or one class here go ahead and press enter and then you can

04:21.500 --> 04:26.680
add other properties such as a text align with the value of center.

04:26.970 --> 04:27.700
All right.

04:27.740 --> 04:33.160
And what this is going to do is going to shift the text right into the center of our screen.

04:33.160 --> 04:33.570
Right.

04:33.580 --> 04:37.160
So all right so kind of making sense getting the hang of it.

04:37.220 --> 04:38.380
Perfect.

04:38.390 --> 04:43.020
All right let's let's add a class to an element now.

04:43.070 --> 04:49.730
So using these these are direct elements k now right underneath our head or one tag.

04:49.730 --> 04:51.560
Go ahead and create a DIV tag.

04:51.740 --> 04:59.240
And to add a class to an element we're going to write the word class equal sign and then to two quotations

04:59.540 --> 05:02.190
and then inside of here we can name our class.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.950
All right and we can name this whatever we want.

05:05.030 --> 05:07.850
And in this case I'm going to this square.

05:08.720 --> 05:09.180
All right.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.820
And then I'm going to go ahead and just close that off.

05:12.830 --> 05:21.230
All right so with this class here too to use it to target it come back over to our success and to grab

05:21.230 --> 05:22.290
a class.

05:22.430 --> 05:24.160
We're going to start with a period.

05:24.350 --> 05:28.040
And then the name of the class that we assign to it.

05:28.040 --> 05:28.370
All right.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.460
And then same thing curly braces we're going to open that up.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.750
And now with this we can add style properties to it.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.250
So for example let's go ahead.

05:37.250 --> 05:43.840
I'm going to build a square here so I'm going to give a width of 100 pixels.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.980
Close it off with a semi cone.

05:45.980 --> 05:49.980
We're going to add a height of 100 pixels.

05:50.240 --> 05:56.240
Close it off with the semi colon and then to top this off let's give a color and I'm going to go ahead

05:56.330 --> 06:01.510
and type in background color and let's give it a name.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.340
What colors do we have to choose from here.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.540
Let's do a blue.

06:04.640 --> 06:09.010
All right something really simple here and then close that off with a semi-colon.

06:09.050 --> 06:13.900
All right and then I'm going to save this I'm going to come back to my preview.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.640
Go ahead and refresh it.

06:15.680 --> 06:21.920
And we have carried a blue square right over here to the left and for this let's go ahead and just Center

06:22.020 --> 06:26.210
all of this content I'm going to come back over to brackets under the square.

06:26.570 --> 06:31.870
I can add a property of margin and then assign a value of auto.

06:31.970 --> 06:38.180
And what this does is it puts equal spacing on each side of my element to center it right in the middle

06:38.180 --> 06:39.670
of the screen.

06:39.680 --> 06:40.300
All right perfect.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.960
So now we've got a square there.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.990
So starting to make sense right.

06:44.990 --> 06:45.340
All right.

06:45.340 --> 06:52.690
Now the last method that we can use to to style an element is an idea and to do that.

06:52.700 --> 06:57.650
Let's create another div tag and this time we're going to write.

06:57.740 --> 07:04.410
ID equals and then two quotations and then we're going to put the name of our idea in here.

07:04.660 --> 07:10.760
All right and then this one in this case I'm going to call a circle and then just let's give it some

07:10.760 --> 07:11.250
text.

07:11.260 --> 07:14.600
Hey I'm a circle.

07:15.260 --> 07:15.850
All right.

07:16.160 --> 07:16.970
Great.

07:16.970 --> 07:20.650
Now one thing to note about using IDS.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.960
All right ideas should be used very very sparingly.

07:24.080 --> 07:30.440
And when we're using an ID whatever name that we're going to assign to it it needs to be very very specific

07:30.440 --> 07:31.620
and very unique.

07:31.670 --> 07:35.200
You shouldn't be using ID's all over the place.

07:35.210 --> 07:35.850
OK.

07:35.900 --> 07:40.070
And I would try to avoid it using IDs to style things.

07:40.080 --> 07:46.430
Ideas allow us to interact with our team mail through javascript and on top of that you can add styles

07:46.430 --> 07:48.360
to them ballots.

07:48.380 --> 07:52.630
Let me show you how we can target this class using an ID.

07:52.820 --> 08:00.470
So over in our C Ss we're going to write a pound sign and then the name of our ID and then the same

08:00.470 --> 08:04.240
curly braces and then we can add a property and a value to it.

08:04.250 --> 08:07.360
So inside of this div tag I've put some text.

08:07.550 --> 08:09.970
So let's go ahead and add some style to it.

08:10.310 --> 08:20.010
Let's make our font color let's go ahead and change this to what shows up on purple or dark red.

08:20.050 --> 08:20.400
All right.

08:20.400 --> 08:26.700
And then we can add a font size and let's make this 40 pixels.

08:26.700 --> 08:27.040
All right.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.040
And that should do it.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.790
That's simple enough.

08:29.790 --> 08:30.030
All right.

08:30.030 --> 08:33.420
Go ahead and save that and then back over to our preview.

08:33.510 --> 08:34.950
Refresh it.

08:34.950 --> 08:36.840
And we have added some text.

08:36.840 --> 08:39.030
Hey I am a circle.

08:39.030 --> 08:44.370
All right let's come back over here to bracket's And let's talk about some use case scenarios when we

08:44.370 --> 08:46.890
would use these different types of selectors.

08:47.100 --> 08:50.060
So for example this Hetter one tag here.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.980
All right we assigned a color and a text line of center.

08:53.190 --> 09:01.200
So in reality what this has done is it's saying every single head or one tag that I use it's going to

09:01.200 --> 09:04.020
have a color of red and it takes a line or center.

09:04.020 --> 09:09.720
Now obviously having a text line of center on every single head tag might not make sense or having the

09:09.720 --> 09:10.520
color red.

09:10.680 --> 09:17.910
So be mindful when you target these elements directly you are assigning a broad style property that

09:17.910 --> 09:19.700
is going to work across the board for you.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.520
All right.

09:20.700 --> 09:28.170
Now when we dive into the class here we've got this class of square what we're doing here is when we

09:28.170 --> 09:32.210
have a lot of elements on the page we can assign different classes to them.

09:32.220 --> 09:33.070
Think of a button.

09:33.090 --> 09:41.460
For example we create a button class and it has a certain size certain font color padding and things

09:41.460 --> 09:42.730
like that different colors.

09:42.900 --> 09:48.750
Now we can create this button class and then every single button that we're using in our page we can

09:48.750 --> 09:51.540
go ahead and add that Button class to it.

09:51.540 --> 09:58.110
So classes are great when you want to use the same styling in multiple areas throughout your web site

09:58.110 --> 09:58.830
or web app.

09:59.130 --> 10:02.590
And then the last thing here these IDs.

10:02.640 --> 10:08.870
Again it's really important that you use these IDs sparingly when you are using it in styling.

10:09.120 --> 10:12.970
Unless it's something very very specific that you need to happen or want.

10:13.110 --> 10:18.810
And again IDs are mainly And traditionally used to interact with your email through javascript.

10:18.830 --> 10:23.520
That said this is the difference between the three different types of selectors.

10:23.520 --> 10:28.050
How do you use them and how you can style your smell with them.
