00:08.720 --> 00:12.070
A what is up everybody this is Jason with death slopes dot com.

00:12.080 --> 00:18.100
And in this video we are going to cover backgrounds and borders in CSSA.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.570
So let's hop to it.

00:20.570 --> 00:20.870
All right.

00:20.870 --> 00:26.710
So we've already learned that with backgrounds we can add a color or a gradient.

00:26.750 --> 00:34.580
Now when we use the term background it's a shorthand for a bunch of other background options that we

00:34.580 --> 00:35.260
may have.

00:35.270 --> 00:37.190
Let me let me show you an example.

00:37.190 --> 00:44.270
So above your container here let's create some space and at the top here what we're going to do is grab

00:44.270 --> 00:45.410
the body tag.

00:45.560 --> 00:45.830
All right.

00:45.830 --> 00:47.180
The body element.

00:47.180 --> 00:54.050
Now when we began typing in the word background you can see that background is a shorthand term but

00:54.050 --> 00:59.930
it also gives us a list of all these other different types of backgrounds we can use such as the background

00:59.930 --> 01:06.580
attachment clip color background image orange position background size.

01:06.620 --> 01:14.870
I mean this is a list of stuff that we can use now when we use the shorthand version of background we

01:14.870 --> 01:19.400
got to know the syntax the value that you can add to the other side of this.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.140
All right.

01:20.470 --> 01:28.160
But however when you use a more specified version of the background property it will kind to give you

01:28.160 --> 01:31.930
some helpers of what kind of values you can throw in there.

01:31.940 --> 01:34.010
So we've got our body selected.

01:34.010 --> 01:40.370
Why don't we go ahead and add a background image to this and we're going to there's a few different

01:40.370 --> 01:42.610
options we can use to add an image.

01:42.620 --> 01:44.780
And I'm going to use the you are L..

01:44.820 --> 01:45.460
All right.

01:45.620 --> 01:48.200
And then go ahead and close that off.

01:48.500 --> 01:53.590
So let's go grab an image now so come into your browser here.

01:54.750 --> 02:01.400
Make this full screen for us and just search for something appropriate.

02:01.400 --> 02:08.550
All right now I'm going to type in minimal zebra background.

02:08.630 --> 02:10.470
All right.

02:10.470 --> 02:12.250
And let's go into images.

02:12.260 --> 02:14.360
I'm just going to grab this first Sieber one here.

02:14.360 --> 02:15.800
That looks pretty good.

02:15.920 --> 02:19.930
And we can see the dimensions is a 600 by 375.

02:20.030 --> 02:25.400
So it's kind of a smaller image but when you're looking for an image I want you to find a smaller image

02:25.490 --> 02:27.170
because I'm going to show you how to work with that.

02:27.170 --> 02:27.780
OK.

02:28.010 --> 02:34.730
So I'm going to go ahead and right click on this save as and I'm going to throw it into my project right

02:34.730 --> 02:35.130
here.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.030
OK.

02:36.410 --> 02:39.850
And I'm going to change the name to just zebra.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.930
And no I do not have rights to this image.

02:41.930 --> 02:45.270
Do not use it commercially unless it says so.

02:45.920 --> 02:49.010
All right so we've got the zebra in our projects.

02:49.010 --> 02:55.230
I'm going to go back here and inside the background image you are l.

02:55.430 --> 03:00.950
I'm going to type in zebra and it's grabbing the zebra because I've just cut it at a top level over

03:00.950 --> 03:02.150
here.

03:02.180 --> 03:05.180
All right so perfect so we've got that in there.

03:05.180 --> 03:07.080
Let's go ahead and see what this looks like.

03:07.190 --> 03:11.190
Going to go ahead and launch the browser here.

03:13.090 --> 03:13.640
Cool.

03:13.700 --> 03:21.440
Well that didn't work as expected or I mean it is taking zebra and it's stamping it all over the place.

03:21.460 --> 03:26.200
Now the reason it's doing this is because we grabbed a smaller image right.

03:26.290 --> 03:34.030
And the browser because it's a specific image size it's filling up the extra space so it doesn't.

03:34.090 --> 03:37.750
So the browser doesn't leave all this white space with it the browser doesn't know what to do with this

03:37.760 --> 03:38.740
exactly.

03:38.770 --> 03:44.140
So let's come over to brackets and go ahead and get the container out of the way just take the content

03:44.620 --> 03:51.370
and I'm pressing command option forward slash just commenting get it out and let's use it a few other

03:51.370 --> 03:54.790
background properties that we can use to help us with this.

03:54.790 --> 03:59.080
So first we saw that our background image was repeating right.

03:59.290 --> 04:06.820
So we can do background repeat property and then it comes with a few different options for us and we're

04:06.820 --> 04:10.040
going to click the no repeat.

04:10.300 --> 04:13.390
All right save that and then let's check it out.

04:13.840 --> 04:14.600
Well cool.

04:14.650 --> 04:20.710
It's not repeating anymore because we told it so the browser is now just giving us one image.

04:20.710 --> 04:21.940
It's not repeating it.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.500
But check this out it's left out this empty white space.

04:25.510 --> 04:33.190
All right so let's learn about another background property back over into brackets right under the background

04:33.200 --> 04:33.920
Rippy.

04:34.120 --> 04:38.120
Let's type in background size OK.

04:38.140 --> 04:41.380
And then we're going to use cover and this.

04:41.380 --> 04:48.120
Now when you're working with a background size this is specific to working with a background image OK.

04:48.460 --> 04:54.220
You can't like set a background size of height or width of anything else that it directly targets the

04:54.220 --> 04:56.790
image that you're working with on the element.

04:56.830 --> 04:57.690
OK.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.820
So let's come back over to here and that looks better.

05:00.820 --> 05:06.550
Right now we've got our image covering the entire viewport of the browser.

05:06.550 --> 05:15.910
Now when you're wanting to use an image as a background to your Web site or your web app do use an image

05:15.910 --> 05:18.370
that has the appropriate dimensions.

05:18.430 --> 05:21.910
Go ahead and resize it you something in high definition.

05:21.910 --> 05:24.930
This was a smaller image and we stretch it out over the viewport.

05:24.930 --> 05:28.630
You can see how fuzzy that it's become.

05:28.630 --> 05:29.560
All right so cool.

05:29.560 --> 05:37.240
That is background's you can use background's for colors and then you can also set backgrounds for images.

05:37.260 --> 05:38.110
All right.

05:38.110 --> 05:43.840
And you can take these background properties here and you could add these two additional elements like

05:43.840 --> 05:50.080
if I had a container and wanted a background to this specific container or a section of my website you

05:50.080 --> 05:52.580
can add a background property to this.

05:52.600 --> 06:01.330
All right so again you can use this shorthand background property and then you come up with the appropriate

06:01.840 --> 06:07.420
value that you can add to it or you can be a little bit more specific in the Bactrim property that you

06:07.420 --> 06:08.380
want to use.

06:08.380 --> 06:09.670
So moving forward.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.640
Let's go ahead and start working with borders.

06:12.670 --> 06:13.580
All right.

06:13.780 --> 06:15.860
So let's come down here.

06:16.240 --> 06:20.020
So we're in our container outside of our container.

06:20.020 --> 06:26.370
Why don't we go ahead and create another div tag here and close that off.

06:26.380 --> 06:29.050
And then inside of here we're just going to throw an image.

06:29.500 --> 06:35.680
So go do an image and we'll give it a source leave it empty for now and then we're going to add a class

06:35.680 --> 06:36.330
onto this.

06:36.340 --> 06:40.380
And I'm just going to type in a border image.

06:40.920 --> 06:41.550
OK.

06:41.800 --> 06:50.040
Awesome So let's go ahead and go grab an image for this and I'm going to come up here like the minimal

06:50.040 --> 06:54.420
stuff so minimal I can.

06:54.450 --> 06:59.180
All right and then let's pop over to images and I'm going to use this one right here.

06:59.270 --> 07:01.640
It's a 400 by 300.

07:01.640 --> 07:04.870
So it's not going to take up my entire web page here.

07:04.880 --> 07:12.050
I'm going to do save image as and again throw this into your project whatever image you decide to use.

07:12.290 --> 07:14.170
And perfect so that's saved.

07:14.270 --> 07:18.950
So back over to brackets inside the image right here in the source.

07:18.950 --> 07:21.980
Let's go ahead and add that image in there.

07:22.010 --> 07:22.640
All right.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.720
So we've added our image and let's check it out make sure it's loading.

07:25.730 --> 07:26.470
Perfect.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.660
So we've got our image right here.

07:28.970 --> 07:33.620
Let's go ahead and work with some borders and different ways that we can use these.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.040
All right.

07:34.050 --> 07:38.760
So come over here we're going to grab the image class that we have.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.900
OK the border image.

07:41.870 --> 07:48.690
And then inside here let me add some space below this so we can see what we're working with here.

07:48.710 --> 07:57.320
So just like using the background property we can use the shorthand for border K and then we can go

07:57.320 --> 08:05.120
ahead and add our value in here and now when you saw this there you can use the shorthand border property

08:05.390 --> 08:08.760
or you can get a little bit more specific like border bottom.

08:08.840 --> 08:16.460
We have colors we have radiuses here we have border styles Whit's collapse colors images border the

08:16.460 --> 08:17.940
left colors.

08:18.140 --> 08:19.080
Tons of stuff right.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.700
We have tons of stuff.

08:20.800 --> 08:29.410
And in this case what I'm going to do is I want to add a border to every single side of this image.

08:29.420 --> 08:37.280
So I'm just going to use the standard shorthand border property so to use a border to add a value we

08:37.280 --> 08:42.230
need to first set the width of the border OK and we can do that with pixels.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.370
So I'm going to set a two pixel with to my border.

08:45.680 --> 08:50.450
Right now we need to define what kind of border we want to use.

08:50.450 --> 08:53.190
And the first one we're going to use as a solid.

08:53.190 --> 08:53.850
All right.

08:54.050 --> 08:58.140
And then the third value that we're going to throw in here is a color.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.430
And let's just use red.

09:00.470 --> 09:02.090
So it shows up easily.

09:02.480 --> 09:07.970
So we've got a border and this is going to put a two pixel radius around the entire thing.

09:08.090 --> 09:12.930
Top right left and bottom we're giving it a solid border of color red.

09:12.940 --> 09:14.290
Let's check that out.

09:14.660 --> 09:15.100
Cool.

09:15.110 --> 09:17.480
So you can see that we've got a red border here.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.520
Very cool.

09:18.530 --> 09:20.990
Now let me show you this.

09:21.020 --> 09:25.550
We could be specific here and just do like a border Right.

09:25.820 --> 09:31.010
And what this is going to do is it's going to add a two pixel solid red border to the right of our image.

09:31.010 --> 09:34.340
Now and we've got that over here.

09:34.370 --> 09:34.730
All right.

09:34.730 --> 09:37.710
I'm going to actually go ahead and make this a little bit thicker so we can see it.

09:37.850 --> 09:39.610
Let's do 10 pixels.

09:39.620 --> 09:45.320
All right so now we've got a thicker border that we can work with and we can also change this value

09:45.320 --> 09:46.130
from a solid.

09:46.130 --> 09:46.450
All right.

09:46.460 --> 09:58.720
We can use a dotted value which is going to give us a dotted line here and then we can also use a dashed

10:00.820 --> 10:04.130
value there and we're going to go ahead and throw this around the entire thing.

10:06.100 --> 10:06.580
All right.

10:06.610 --> 10:08.440
Pretty simple stuff right.

10:08.470 --> 10:09.900
Very very easy.

10:10.360 --> 10:17.650
And that wraps up this lesson we have learned how to use colors and images with backgrounds in addition

10:17.650 --> 10:18.510
to gradients.

10:18.520 --> 10:23.920
And then we've also learned how to use borders and the different ways that we can style them so that's

10:23.920 --> 10:24.530
a wrap.

10:24.610 --> 10:26.160
Let's move on.
