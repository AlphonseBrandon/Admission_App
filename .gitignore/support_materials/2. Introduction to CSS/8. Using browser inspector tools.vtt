WEBVTT

00:04.790 --> 00:05.820
The

00:08.960 --> 00:09.950
YO WHAT IS UP.

00:10.020 --> 00:12.690
Everybody this is Jason Woodruffs Klopstock com.

00:12.710 --> 00:17.780
And in this video we're going to cover some developer tools that are really going to help you when you're

00:17.780 --> 00:20.960
designing web pages and web applications.

00:20.960 --> 00:21.150
All right.

00:21.170 --> 00:27.410
And what this tool is it's an inspector tool that helps you see a little under the hood of what's going

00:27.410 --> 00:30.320
on with your HLN CSSA in the browser.

00:30.320 --> 00:33.340
So let's go ahead we've got our project opened here.

00:33.350 --> 00:41.090
Go ahead and launch it and the first browser we're going to cover is the inspector tools for Chrome.

00:41.090 --> 00:41.450
All right.

00:41.450 --> 00:42.860
So we've got our project here.

00:42.890 --> 00:48.290
And what I want you to do is I want you to right click and then come down to the bottom and click this

00:48.530 --> 00:56.550
tab inspect all right and what that brings is this Inspektor tool right here in the bottom.

00:56.550 --> 00:59.600
All right so let me show you how to use this.

00:59.790 --> 01:07.140
So what this is is you can see as I highlight these different levels it's targeting different sections

01:07.140 --> 01:09.930
of my website so you can see that we've got the head here.

01:09.930 --> 01:15.330
And then once I come into the body we see that the whole page highlights and then if I come down one

01:15.330 --> 01:20.640
more you can see this is the container that we created so I'm going to actually go ahead and click on

01:20.640 --> 01:21.280
this.

01:21.600 --> 01:27.840
And then you've got these little arrows here you can expand the content to see what's inside of here

01:28.290 --> 01:33.290
so you can see that I've got this class and we added our a container class to this remember.

01:33.450 --> 01:37.890
And for the container we actually removed the styling.

01:37.890 --> 01:45.240
So if you come over here to the right side this section over here under Stiles is going to show you

01:45.480 --> 01:48.280
all the success rules that you have on your elements.

01:48.570 --> 01:52.910
So you can see that the container is empty because we commented that out.

01:53.100 --> 01:57.470
But then you'll also see that we have a DIV tag here with a display of block.

01:57.480 --> 02:06.860
So by nature C Ss puts a display of block on div tags K and you can see that a DIV tag with this display.

02:06.930 --> 02:09.780
It covers the entire viewport of our browser.

02:09.870 --> 02:10.440
All right.

02:10.500 --> 02:14.040
So let's come down a little deeper and let's go into the head of one tag.

02:14.040 --> 02:19.110
You can see up top here that it's highlighting it and you can see that we've got the head or one tag

02:19.110 --> 02:20.100
selected.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.260
The blue is directly around the tecs.

02:22.440 --> 02:27.410
And then we've got this orange around it which actually indicates margin.

02:27.450 --> 02:33.600
And let's come over here to the right side into the stiles so we can see that our head or one tag we

02:33.600 --> 02:39.130
can see the style rules that we put on here and we put a color of white and that text shadow on there

02:39.480 --> 02:45.030
and it's got these checkboxes next to it and you can see in the browser as I check and uncheck these

02:46.010 --> 02:50.580
how or remove the style and add it back on as I check.

02:50.580 --> 02:51.040
All right.

02:51.060 --> 02:56.770
And then you can see that the head or one element by nature has a display of Block.

02:56.790 --> 02:58.860
It's got a font size to it.

02:58.860 --> 02:59.940
And then check this out.

02:59.940 --> 03:04.150
It has a margin added to the top and bottom.

03:04.210 --> 03:05.000
All right.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.190
And then a font weight.

03:06.210 --> 03:12.440
Bold and then right down here at the bottom this actually shows you the dimensions of your element.

03:12.570 --> 03:20.610
So we can see here the size of the text the display of block expands the entire viewport by a 3:41 and

03:20.610 --> 03:25.760
then my head or one text is actually thirty seven pixels tall.

03:25.950 --> 03:29.660
And then we don't have any padding which you can see this highlight screen.

03:29.730 --> 03:35.460
The borders are a kind of a light orange yellow and then the margin is orange and you can see that it

03:35.460 --> 03:38.500
has a margin of 21 point for four.

03:38.520 --> 03:45.360
So that is Hetter one tags default style of propertys style rules.

03:45.540 --> 03:53.040
And then if we come into the head or two we can come here we can see the specific style rules we added

03:53.040 --> 03:55.110
to this with the color and text shadow.

03:55.110 --> 04:02.490
And then again it has default properties of display font sizes a little bit smaller the margins are

04:02.490 --> 04:03.270
a little bit smaller.

04:03.270 --> 04:08.910
And again we have the actual dimensions down here at the very very bottom it shows the dimensions of

04:08.910 --> 04:09.850
our element.

04:09.900 --> 04:13.490
So let's learn how to use this a little more.

04:13.830 --> 04:20.730
So over here in the far left corner we've got this selector tool and when we click that you can see

04:21.090 --> 04:26.190
that we can hover around our page and it's going to select elements.

04:26.190 --> 04:31.650
So for example I stop here on the image and I can go ahead and click it and kind of like drops a pin

04:31.920 --> 04:40.590
and automatically right here in the element Inspektor it highlights my image we can see the source the

04:40.710 --> 04:45.090
J-P the PMG file that it's grabbing and the class that we added to it.

04:45.180 --> 04:51.330
And then over here on the stiles on the right you can see our class with the border and remember how

04:51.330 --> 04:54.740
we did a border of 10 pixels dashed red.

04:54.760 --> 05:01.680
Well check this how we can expand this and it gives us detailed colors that because we use the shorthand

05:01.680 --> 05:09.930
border look it actually used the properties border top right color border top style the with the right

05:09.930 --> 05:11.570
color right styled right with.

05:11.670 --> 05:18.780
And so just by using the short and here it kind of compiles and this is the actual list of all the default

05:19.290 --> 05:21.250
styles that it added for us.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.430
So that's pretty cool.

05:23.430 --> 05:30.060
Now the other thing we can do is we can actually take this web page that we've created and if we click

05:30.120 --> 05:38.130
on this right here toggle device toolbar this is going to put this web page in a mobile view this page

05:38.130 --> 05:41.360
that we built here isn't set up for mobile.

05:41.430 --> 05:42.480
So why don't you go ahead.

05:42.480 --> 05:49.420
Open up a new tab and just go to dev slopes dot com.

05:49.450 --> 05:49.790
All right.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.490
And then in here.

05:51.540 --> 05:56.790
Let's go ahead and Right-Click and we're going to inspect.

05:57.030 --> 06:02.070
And then let's go ahead and click on this toggle right here for the devices.

06:02.370 --> 06:04.280
I mean get rid of this pop up.

06:04.500 --> 06:09.960
Go ahead and click that and let's do this up here at the top.

06:09.960 --> 06:14.070
You've got this dropdown menu and it has a bunch of different phones in it.

06:14.070 --> 06:20.250
So let's go ahead and select the iPhone 6 plus or I'm going to move this down just a little bit so we

06:20.250 --> 06:23.640
can increase the size.

06:23.730 --> 06:25.740
Let's do that window that's 50 percent.

06:25.740 --> 06:28.130
Let's see if we can bump it up to 75.

06:28.130 --> 06:28.370
All right.

06:28.380 --> 06:29.650
That works.

06:29.700 --> 06:36.900
So now you can see that we've got an iPhone 6 plus selected and it takes your web application web site

06:37.230 --> 06:42.240
and it puts it into a mobile state so you can actually see what this is going to look like and you can

06:42.240 --> 06:45.540
see that I've got my little round bubble cursor here.

06:45.540 --> 06:52.310
This is like a touch screen so we can go ahead and click on the X up here we've got the side menu.

06:52.560 --> 06:58.080
We've got different sections that we can go to and it's going to load the content and then down here

06:58.170 --> 07:05.790
again we can see that we've got a list of elements here that we can inspect to see what kind of style

07:05.790 --> 07:06.750
rules on it.

07:06.750 --> 07:13.860
So I can go ahead and click the selector tool again select this first image and then in a mobile state

07:14.100 --> 07:17.530
we can see all the classes that are assigned to this.

07:17.550 --> 07:17.790
Right.

07:17.790 --> 07:22.100
And then over here in the styles and others is a little hard to see and let me pull it up here.

07:22.320 --> 07:28.210
We can see all the style rules that are applied to this image so.

07:28.390 --> 07:29.020
Pretty cool stuff.

07:29.020 --> 07:31.920
So that's how you work with Chrome.

07:31.930 --> 07:32.560
All right.

07:32.560 --> 07:37.020
And then I want to show you Firefox and Safari.

07:37.240 --> 07:43.850
So wherever your project is located open up your project folder that we're working in.

07:43.850 --> 07:44.520
All right.

07:44.530 --> 07:51.940
And then go ahead and select the HTML file and I want you to right click on it and then do an open with

07:52.600 --> 07:56.470
and then I'm going to go ahead and select Firefox this time.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.350
All right so now we've got our project in Firefox.

07:59.350 --> 08:06.430
So again to inspect her element with Firefox we're going to right click click inspect element and it's

08:06.430 --> 08:08.030
the same similar concept.

08:08.040 --> 08:14.290
OK you've got your elements here on the left and you've got your styles here on the right.

08:14.320 --> 08:19.570
So if I click on the container and I expand this you can see again that we've got our head of ones and

08:19.800 --> 08:20.410
twos.

08:20.710 --> 08:24.440
And then over here on the right we've got our style properties to it.

08:24.930 --> 08:27.360
All right and then same thing with the head or twos.

08:27.460 --> 08:32.290
Now we can also again click the arrow right here.

08:32.290 --> 08:39.670
And again it's going to allow us to select different elements on our page and we can select that and

08:39.670 --> 08:45.460
it's going to jump to the element right here in our inspector and we can view the star properties here

08:45.460 --> 08:48.720
on the right and then it has a few other options here.

08:48.730 --> 08:55.230
So if we click this guy right here this is going to tell us whether we want to position this inspectorship

08:55.240 --> 08:56.400
on the right.

08:56.590 --> 09:03.820
We can go ahead and slap it down here on the bottom and we've got a option to do the same thing that

09:03.820 --> 09:07.160
we did in Chrome and put this in a responsive design mode.

09:07.540 --> 09:11.260
All right so move our inspector down and we've got it over here.

09:11.320 --> 09:17.720
Now what I want you to do is you can slide to this and it's going to give you different dimension screens.

09:18.220 --> 09:23.050
All right so I'm going to actually go back and create a mobile phone here and then if we click this

09:23.440 --> 09:27.070
little hand here this is going to allow us to click around or website.

09:27.430 --> 09:34.450
But again why don't we go ahead and open up dev slopes website so we can check it out in a mobile state.

09:34.450 --> 09:42.590
So right click inspect element and then come over to this responsive design mode.

09:42.610 --> 09:47.210
So we've got that pulled up again and I'm going to make this a little smaller.

09:47.230 --> 09:48.340
Perfect.

09:49.030 --> 09:53.470
And then to navigate this right now we can't click on anything you see that you've got to click this

09:53.470 --> 09:59.710
little hand here and it's weird because Firefox says that you might need to reload the page and refresh

09:59.710 --> 10:03.300
it which I do every time so go ahead and click it.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.960
I'm going to hit command are.

10:05.020 --> 10:09.890
You could go ahead and click the refresh button here and refreshing the page.

10:10.270 --> 10:16.550
And now I can go ahead and I can click on it so I can navigate my page in a mobile state.

10:17.050 --> 10:17.800
All right.

10:17.800 --> 10:23.340
So very cool we've covered that and that is Firefox.

10:23.410 --> 10:29.200
Let's go ahead and close this and let's check this out in Safari now Safari is a little bit different.

10:29.230 --> 10:35.050
So again go to your project folder right click on the index file and do open with.

10:35.320 --> 10:38.560
And we're going to go ahead and select Safari this time.

10:38.740 --> 10:41.580
So come and click safari.

10:41.610 --> 10:42.960
We've got it opened up here.

10:43.120 --> 10:48.310
Now if I right click you'll notice that I don't have an inspect element here.

10:48.310 --> 10:48.640
Right.

10:48.640 --> 10:56.500
We've only got these four options to allow inspect element on safari come over and click the Safari

10:56.620 --> 10:58.590
click preferences.

10:58.690 --> 11:03.460
We're going to come all the way over here and then down here at the bottom it says show develop menu

11:03.460 --> 11:04.990
in menu bar.

11:04.990 --> 11:11.650
So when we click that you'll see that we got a new tab up here on safari called develop and we can go

11:11.650 --> 11:13.000
ahead and close this.

11:13.090 --> 11:17.930
Now when I right click I can now inspect the element.

11:18.090 --> 11:22.910
All right and same thing here so we've got all of our elements nested inside.

11:22.910 --> 11:29.870
Here we can expand them highlight them if we want to target a specific element come over here to this

11:30.020 --> 11:37.910
little safari scope target thing and you can you know go ahead and select elements and we'll bring you

11:38.120 --> 11:39.960
to the element here on your right.

11:41.180 --> 11:48.980
And let me come back here cut off my element page and then if we want we can reposition this.

11:49.040 --> 11:55.040
Just click this right here for the right side you can click it for the bottom you can click this here

11:55.370 --> 12:02.330
and actually pop the inspector outside of the web page here which I really like especially if you're

12:02.330 --> 12:07.880
using two screens you can pop out the inspector throw this on your second screen so it's out of the

12:07.880 --> 12:10.610
way and use it that way.

12:10.610 --> 12:17.740
So let's go ahead and dock this again and then if we want to check out the mobile responsive design

12:17.740 --> 12:19.240
of the site.

12:19.240 --> 12:19.840
Let's go ahead.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.550
Open up a new tab.

12:21.550 --> 12:28.510
Again I'm going to have slopestyle com and then this time we're going to select the developed tab here

12:29.140 --> 12:34.380
we can come down and select enter a responsive design mode and there is a hot key for that.

12:34.390 --> 12:38.680
So if we click this I really like the way Apple set it up it's very clean.

12:38.710 --> 12:46.870
You can select the different devices here and then from here you can go ahead and right click on it

12:46.930 --> 12:49.070
and then inspect the element.

12:49.070 --> 12:56.400
So we can go in head and take the target tool and select an element in here and it's kind of highlighted

12:56.400 --> 12:58.100
here in our element.

12:58.120 --> 13:06.390
Inspector that completes this lesson we have learned how to use the inspector tools in Chrome Firefox

13:06.420 --> 13:07.310
and Safari.

13:07.350 --> 13:10.630
And you're going to be using this a lot especially when working with CSSA.

13:10.740 --> 13:16.920
When you have elements not being displayed properly or being positioned weird and especially when you

13:16.920 --> 13:22.040
have style rules running in or messing with other style rules so that's a wrap.

13:22.050 --> 13:23.380
Let's move on.

13:23.520 --> 13:28.770
Yes.
