00:05.850 --> 00:10.930
Wasn't back to class everyone Mark Price you're at death's slopes dot.com and in this exciting video

00:11.290 --> 00:13.480
we're going to learn a little bit about lists.

00:13.660 --> 00:13.980
OK.

00:14.020 --> 00:15.160
And some other things.

00:15.160 --> 00:15.370
All right.

00:15.370 --> 00:17.660
No big deal no big deal.

00:17.710 --> 00:22.330
So we've got our body here and what I want to do is going to make the font size a little bit smaller

00:22.540 --> 00:29.020
just so I can have small writing space and I'll make this a little bit smaller too.

00:29.230 --> 00:33.350
So we can see a little bit better one size bigger.

00:33.350 --> 00:34.200
OK.

00:34.720 --> 00:35.950
So we've got our body.

00:35.980 --> 00:41.440
We've got header here now like any Web site we want to have some links right to some of our courses.

00:41.470 --> 00:46.980
So let's go ahead and create some links and we're going to do that using an unordered list.

00:47.260 --> 00:47.970
OK.

00:48.370 --> 00:50.490
And an order list just means that they're on order.

00:50.590 --> 00:55.000
There's no need to be one two three four five is just a list.

00:55.000 --> 00:55.590
OK.

00:55.890 --> 01:00.700
And so inside of her on orderless we're going to have a series of list items like so.

01:00.880 --> 01:01.550
OK.

01:01.870 --> 01:06.490
And again it's important if you want to get this autocomplete that you need to use a tool here like

01:06.490 --> 01:11.420
brackets if you're not already you some LOT of mistakes if you're writing it from scratch.

01:11.570 --> 01:14.160
And just a text note a text pad or something.

01:14.230 --> 01:17.100
And so we got a list item here.

01:17.110 --> 01:20.510
And let's go ahead and put some things in it like let's say the home page.

01:20.680 --> 01:21.410
OK.

01:21.730 --> 01:29.950
And then let's do another list item and we're going to say about OK press command or control to the

01:29.950 --> 01:31.490
right to go to the end of the line.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.100
That's kind of cool.

01:33.450 --> 01:35.120
Item courses.

01:35.170 --> 01:35.650
OK.

01:35.840 --> 01:36.250
All right.

01:36.250 --> 01:39.710
So we've got some list items here we got some links but we can't even click on these links.

01:39.910 --> 01:44.890
So what we want to do is make them clickable and we can do that using the a tag.

01:44.890 --> 01:50.560
So so far we got a unordered list tag and a list item tag and we can actually have tags within tags

01:50.590 --> 01:51.450
which is really cool.

01:51.460 --> 01:52.720
Well you've already seen that though.

01:52.760 --> 01:56.080
You go ahead and a title and a body in a header here.

01:56.200 --> 02:03.310
So let's do another one called a K or an essay ref equals I don't put a pound sign in here and I'll

02:03.310 --> 02:06.390
tell you about that in just a moment here.

02:06.880 --> 02:11.930
OK so we've got home and what I can do is I can command X or control.

02:12.110 --> 02:18.110
To cut that and paste are in there now if you notice this the whole text is clickable.

02:18.120 --> 02:18.840
It's a link now.

02:18.880 --> 02:19.530
OK.

02:19.820 --> 02:24.670
And so the Tref is the destination your rule that you want to go to.

02:24.680 --> 02:28.670
And I just put a pound here so I don't want it to go anywhere I want it to stay on this page because

02:28.670 --> 02:36.470
we don't have other pages but if I did want to go somewhere I could say HEG P.S. Google dot com and

02:36.470 --> 02:38.170
I save this and click on it.

02:38.540 --> 02:38.940
OK.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.390
It takes us to Google dot com.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.660
Now that's not what we want.

02:41.660 --> 02:42.880
And we lost our live preview.

02:42.890 --> 02:44.100
We left the page.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.830
So we will open that up again.

02:46.590 --> 02:47.760
And I'm going to undo this.

02:47.860 --> 02:50.040
Back to the pound sign.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.160
So pretty good right.

02:51.160 --> 02:57.130
So if you want to show a link something that's clickable you just go ahead and put the link tag here.

02:57.130 --> 03:01.740
And then inside the tag and before the ending a tag we go ahead and put the word.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.450
We put the word in there the link that you want to click.

03:04.450 --> 03:10.060
Now I could not have I didn't put this link on the outside of the list item because I didn't want to

03:10.060 --> 03:15.110
break the unordered list so I put it in here for a reason and we'll do the same thing here with all

03:15.110 --> 03:15.430
of these.

03:15.430 --> 03:15.770
OK.

03:15.820 --> 03:21.180
I'm just going to copy this and paste it here and paste it here.

03:21.200 --> 03:24.800
And we're going to change this to what they were before about.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.440
Of course now we got this.

03:26.470 --> 03:34.000
Now we have some nice links and if you're wondering well how do I get these links to show up like horizontally

03:34.000 --> 03:34.870
and vertically.

03:35.110 --> 03:36.920
Well we really can't do that without CSSA.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.360
And so we're just doing pure HVM right now.

03:39.460 --> 03:44.020
And so you're kind of seeing what web development was like in the very very beginning before we had

03:44.020 --> 03:47.590
cool things like stylesheets that we could work with.

03:47.590 --> 03:49.270
So we got a list here this is coming up.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.120
Nice.

03:50.140 --> 03:53.850
What about a nice line separating line to divide our page.

03:53.850 --> 03:55.150
Let's work on that now.

03:56.420 --> 04:03.060
Bait a line in our page a horizontal line by putting in the art tag like so.

04:03.260 --> 04:10.320
And this is one of those tags that you can see right here that didn't need an ending for Slash.

04:10.370 --> 04:11.090
OK.

04:11.150 --> 04:17.870
And H.R. stands for horizontal rule and in as far as HDMI 4.0 and below that sort of meant for horizontal

04:17.870 --> 04:22.070
rule whereas now it's more of a dramatic change in the page.

04:22.070 --> 04:25.690
I know it's really a difference in semantics here.

04:25.730 --> 04:29.540
Some things have changed between versions all but more or less this is what you get right out of the

04:29.540 --> 04:29.840
box.

04:29.840 --> 04:34.280
And if you want to stylus and things like that you do that all in C Ss which we're not doing right now.

04:34.370 --> 04:38.630
So so far we've got a unordered list and we've got a series list items and you can have as many list

04:38.630 --> 04:41.320
items inside your unordered list as you want.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.200
Now we've got a nice little dividing line.

04:43.250 --> 04:49.220
And so what we probably want next is a way to actually write some text on the page.

04:49.480 --> 04:50.030
Okay.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.530
And I want to do that under the rule here.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.970
And what I want to do is use the paragraph tag another paragraph tag.

04:55.970 --> 04:58.880
This lets you enter some text and has some basic formatting properties.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.740
Do we need it to write text.

05:00.770 --> 05:01.700
Actually no we don't.

05:01.730 --> 05:02.830
See I'm typing here.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.030
I could easily have taken it off and typed.

05:05.260 --> 05:07.440
OK but we want the formatting that it gives us.

05:07.450 --> 05:09.570
OK so we'll see.

05:10.290 --> 05:14.320
And you know you didn't notice much of a difference if any at all.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.170
Was there a difference.

05:15.170 --> 05:18.760
I don't think there was no there's no difference really visually.

05:19.060 --> 05:23.150
But you're going to want to make sure you always put your text inside of tags because there are formatting

05:23.150 --> 05:28.370
things that you're going to want to do you don't ever want floating text or data that is not enclosed

05:28.400 --> 05:30.740
inside of some type of tag.

05:30.740 --> 05:31.500
OK.

05:32.180 --> 05:44.470
Of slopes is the world's most effective and affordable platform to learn how to code.

05:44.860 --> 05:45.150
OK.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.990
So there's a nice little description.

05:47.040 --> 05:47.790
OK.

05:48.190 --> 05:50.930
You know it's not too bad.

05:51.270 --> 05:51.930
What else.

05:51.950 --> 05:53.940
Maybe we make it a little bit longer.

05:54.360 --> 06:08.840
So we take practical real world experiences and bring them to you in a fun hands on environment.

06:08.840 --> 06:09.370
There we go.

06:09.380 --> 06:10.220
Make it two lines.

06:10.220 --> 06:11.220
It's much better.

06:11.470 --> 06:11.710
OK.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.790
So cool.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.150
That's just a paragraph tag.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.240
And that's our Web site starting to come together.

06:17.330 --> 06:19.300
It's really kind of cool actually.

06:19.430 --> 06:24.710
We haven't done that much but with very simple tools we have actually started to build a web site so

06:24.710 --> 06:27.770
what have you learned so far in this video we learned about unordered lists.

06:27.770 --> 06:32.050
Can we put list items here you can also work with orderless.

06:32.060 --> 06:34.370
But we'll talk about that a little bit later.

06:34.430 --> 06:40.470
And we've also talked about the paragraph tag how you put text in it which is pretty cool.

06:40.640 --> 06:44.030
We can do some other things too inside of here.

06:44.570 --> 06:56.470
Like I can put an eye here for italic size and we can go ahead and paste text and there Hoopes I pay

06:56.640 --> 06:57.050
too much.

06:57.050 --> 07:01.870
The World's the world's most effective.

07:01.880 --> 07:02.630
There you go.

07:02.700 --> 07:08.400
I guess look on the page here that is now in italics which is pretty cool.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.300
And then let's say we want to do the word fun.

07:10.410 --> 07:12.530
I can put a tag for bold.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.590
OK like so.

07:16.630 --> 07:20.870
OK def slopes is the world's most effective and affordable platform to learn how to code.

07:20.870 --> 07:24.920
We take practical real experiences and bring them to you in a fun hands on environment.

07:24.920 --> 07:29.740
Just realize I haven't said any corny jokes in the last few videos and I am completely sorry.

07:30.110 --> 07:32.120
Sorry for being so serious.

07:32.270 --> 07:35.920
Because HTL is just such a serious serious thing.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.180
So fun hands on about this is looking good.

07:38.180 --> 07:38.870
We've learned a lot.

07:38.930 --> 07:40.620
Let's go ahead and call this video done.

07:40.640 --> 07:45.390
There's more to cover but not that much because HVM L is not that hard.

07:45.410 --> 07:50.020
So let's go ahead and stop here and I'll see you next time our price at death slopes.

07:50.040 --> 07:50.500
Dot.com.
