WEBVTT

00:06.780 --> 00:07.650
What's up everyone.

00:07.660 --> 00:14.380
Mark pricer slopes dot com and we are going to dive into the wide world of HVM DML and what you're going

00:14.380 --> 00:18.440
to find as we go through this is that you going to learn really fast.

00:18.940 --> 00:19.420
OK.

00:19.430 --> 00:21.500
He is actually quite simple once you pick it up.

00:21.520 --> 00:26.470
And so what we're going to do now it's going to seem extended because I'm going to go in detail on things

00:26.950 --> 00:31.940
but you'll later look back and be like wow this I can learn this in five minutes what you can.

00:31.990 --> 00:32.460
So.

00:32.620 --> 00:34.170
And it's OK if it takes a little bit longer.

00:34.240 --> 00:40.320
For those who are absolutely knew and had never coded anything but it's relatively straightforward once

00:40.330 --> 00:41.140
you get the hang of it here.

00:41.140 --> 00:45.330
So I'm going to go ahead and create a new folder.

00:45.580 --> 00:51.480
I want to go over here to my courses my ultimate web development course Section 1 and create a new folder

00:51.480 --> 00:58.450
here called Code recording the code for when I'm recording and I'm going to create a new folder called

00:58.570 --> 00:59.930
Hello world.

01:00.610 --> 01:04.130
And actually no we're going to call this just.

01:04.450 --> 01:06.200
We'll call this first web site.

01:06.760 --> 01:07.930
That's what I meant to do.

01:08.320 --> 01:13.940
And what I'm going to do is open the folder in brackets so let's go find brackets.

01:14.320 --> 01:20.920
OK I've got another project open here I'm just going to go to file open folder and we are going to go

01:21.580 --> 01:23.190
find what we just created.

01:27.370 --> 01:29.700
And this I can see all these invisible files.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.700
Which is why we're seeing all this stuff here.

01:32.370 --> 01:35.780
And it was in documents that I put it in.

01:35.790 --> 01:37.160
Sure enough it was OK.

01:37.280 --> 01:43.230
Documents Section 1 Code recording first web site open.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.580
As you can see there's nothing here so let's go in and create a new file.

01:46.650 --> 01:49.860
We're going to call this index HVM l now.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.020
Question of the day is does it have to be named index.

01:52.020 --> 01:53.490
And the answer is no.

01:53.490 --> 01:58.590
However when you're building Web sites the typical entry point file that you have will be called index

01:58.920 --> 02:06.810
T.M. and servers like if you host on a server like Go Daddy or just some place that's hosting your files

02:06.820 --> 02:13.860
your static files will look for an index the T.M. or indexed up DHP to get your project started and

02:13.860 --> 02:15.070
loaded on the browser.

02:16.090 --> 02:16.510
OK.

02:16.520 --> 02:16.970
Perfect.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.260
So here we go.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.180
We're going to start off by doing something called doc type.

02:22.380 --> 02:23.680
OK.

02:23.720 --> 02:24.930
And then HVM else.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.340
Now this is not an HTML tag.

02:27.340 --> 02:32.590
This is simply a statement that lets your browser know which version of HTML that you are using.

02:32.600 --> 02:38.070
And currently we are using HTML 5 which is why we don't do anything else except write HGL here and ASTM

02:38.130 --> 02:41.150
5 is widely supported among all browsers.

02:41.150 --> 02:47.360
And if you are developing on Windows I highly recommend that you do not do any testing on your Microsoft

02:47.360 --> 02:49.490
edge or at least do your development work.

02:49.490 --> 02:55.850
You can do your testing on it because most people don't use that and the developer tools available on

02:55.850 --> 02:58.340
Chrome and Firefox are much better.

02:58.340 --> 03:03.290
So you always have a document stating what type of HTML version that you're using.

03:03.290 --> 03:03.750
OK.

03:03.950 --> 03:08.330
And some browsers you don't need to put that on there but it can cause problems so it's always recommended

03:08.330 --> 03:09.280
that you put it there.

03:09.380 --> 03:14.030
The next thing we're going to do to start off is we're going to put an age DML tag.

03:14.200 --> 03:14.440
OK.

03:14.450 --> 03:17.310
This is a tag and this is the beginning of your document.

03:17.450 --> 03:18.080
OK.

03:18.350 --> 03:19.770
Pretty cool.

03:19.790 --> 03:25.070
The next thing you're going to do is put in the body and a body is like the content just think of a

03:25.070 --> 03:25.520
person.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.480
You've got the head and then you've got the body.

03:27.700 --> 03:28.060
OK.

03:28.070 --> 03:31.790
So inside the body is where you can actually write different things.

03:31.910 --> 03:35.240
So let's go ahead now that we've got some HTL here.

03:35.240 --> 03:39.860
Let's go ahead and save this file comment s and let's click the lightning bolt over here for a live

03:39.860 --> 03:46.370
preview to see what actually happens when we load it as you can see our screen is blank.

03:46.390 --> 03:47.120
Is it working.

03:47.140 --> 03:48.240
Well it's hard to know.

03:48.250 --> 03:52.060
So what I'm going to do is from day one I'm going to teach you the professional development tools that

03:52.060 --> 03:54.580
you'll be using in your life as a web developer.

03:54.580 --> 04:00.370
So what we're going to do is hold down control alt and J or command alt j which is going to open up

04:00.370 --> 04:01.440
the console.

04:01.620 --> 04:02.540
OK.

04:02.830 --> 04:04.380
So fail to load resource.

04:04.470 --> 04:06.890
It can't find fabby Konda ICAO which is fine.

04:06.910 --> 04:10.840
You're always going to see this error unless you provide a little icon up here and which we don't.

04:10.840 --> 04:13.510
We don't need that and so I'm here on the console tab.

04:13.510 --> 04:18.310
OK this is the Google Chrome console and that command command all Jair control alt j that only works

04:18.310 --> 04:19.440
on google chrome.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.340
OK.

04:20.800 --> 04:25.400
Firefox has their own development tools were using Google Chrome in this course.

04:25.410 --> 04:26.950
Lets see the elements that are here.

04:27.070 --> 04:29.040
If you click elements you can hover over them.

04:29.110 --> 04:29.790
OK.

04:29.860 --> 04:31.600
And it shows the CSSA down here.

04:31.600 --> 04:36.400
Now this is just boilerplate C-s us and we didn't write any of this but pretty cool.

04:36.400 --> 04:41.800
We can see what's in our body which actually is nothing right now so this will be very important for

04:41.800 --> 04:43.360
us moving forward.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.620
So nothing's happening though.

04:44.620 --> 04:46.120
And what's the reason why.

04:46.120 --> 04:50.430
Well it's because we haven't written anything to display on here so let's go ahead and do that now.

04:50.950 --> 04:56.170
We're going to pretend that we're building a simplified version of def slopes learned to code website

04:56.170 --> 04:59.690
where you come to the Web site you can find some various courses and you can buy them or watch them.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.430
OK.

05:00.510 --> 05:06.610
And so what we want to do is we kind of want to have some type of banner saying welcome to our page.

05:06.610 --> 05:12.460
So we're going to say welcome to devs slopes command to save or control us.

05:12.670 --> 05:21.780
And if we go back over to our preview here OK I think we lost our live connection because I opened up

05:21.780 --> 05:24.230
the console source open this up again.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.800
Welcome to the slopes sure enough it's right there.

05:30.050 --> 05:30.610
OK.

05:30.790 --> 05:35.620
And what I do want to do is open up the console again another way to do that is right click and go to

05:35.620 --> 05:36.820
inspect.

05:36.920 --> 05:41.540
This will open up the console and it will let you inspect it here and sure enough whereas it was empty

05:41.540 --> 05:44.700
before it now has an H1 tag here.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.770
Data brackets equals five.

05:46.870 --> 05:48.230
That just has to do with brackets.

05:48.230 --> 05:50.650
They're inserting that for us dynamically.

05:50.650 --> 05:54.680
Here in this as it's running this don't worry about that has nothing to do with our project.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.340
It's simply with this tool so we can do the live preview.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.430
And then there's the text welcome to def slopes.

05:59.440 --> 05:59.810
OK.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.870
And again don't worry about the equals to zero as well too.

06:02.890 --> 06:05.640
That has nothing to do with what we're writing here.

06:05.680 --> 06:09.850
These are just some debug tools that has been inserted for us.

06:09.850 --> 06:10.610
Very cool.

06:10.930 --> 06:14.200
And some say that these are just basic style sheets that are implemented for us.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.300
We didn't write any of that either.

06:15.290 --> 06:16.680
OK that's default stuff.

06:16.930 --> 06:18.710
So pretty cool stuff here.

06:18.850 --> 06:23.050
Live preview is cancelled because the browsers developed portals were opened so just know your live

06:23.050 --> 06:26.370
preview will actually not work if you pull up and the developer tools.

06:26.770 --> 06:30.030
And if you don't remember the live preview is very powerful.

06:30.040 --> 06:33.280
It lets us do things like code and watch the results at the same time.

06:33.280 --> 06:38.320
So if I say welcome to def slopes exclamation exclamation exclamation the live preview shows that real

06:38.320 --> 06:42.390
time which is why I like to use brackets because that's pretty darn cool.

06:43.030 --> 06:48.330
OK so what we've done so far is we've created the we specify what type of HTL we're using.

06:48.370 --> 06:53.250
We've started with the HTML tag and we've ended using the backslash here.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.180
Where is that fourth slash that's a forward slash.

06:55.180 --> 06:57.500
We've used the forward slash to end the HDMI.

06:57.510 --> 07:05.110
Every time you write well most tags and T.M. OK we'll have a Ford slash on them to show that we're ending

07:05.110 --> 07:05.230
it.

07:05.230 --> 07:05.610
OK.

07:05.620 --> 07:10.660
And notice how they kind of line up here if you want to move things around like indent them you can

07:10.660 --> 07:14.500
press tab to indent or shift and tab to unindexed.

07:14.530 --> 07:14.820
OK.

07:14.830 --> 07:16.550
And we've used the header tags so far.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.370
This is where H-1 stands for.

07:18.370 --> 07:22.450
There are other multiple header tags available to us which I can show you right now.

07:22.460 --> 07:27.180
So say H-2 welcome to slopes.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.440
OK.

07:28.720 --> 07:29.890
Are starting to see a trend here.

07:29.910 --> 07:32.310
H-3 welcome to DENSELOW

07:35.820 --> 07:41.750
H for same thing right I'll come to that slopes pretty cool right.

07:41.980 --> 07:45.770
So let's see what happens if I take this tag off.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.470
Well this still looks the same.

07:48.470 --> 07:49.090
This is read.

07:49.110 --> 07:50.970
Yelling at us here but it looks fine.

07:50.970 --> 07:51.630
What's the problem.

07:51.630 --> 07:53.120
Let's see if anything's happening.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.790
Command J.

07:55.500 --> 07:56.930
Let's go to elements.

07:57.180 --> 07:57.730
OK.

07:57.900 --> 07:59.680
So you got an H for here.

07:59.730 --> 08:00.350
And look at that.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.330
For some reason it's like inserting it for us automatically.

08:03.330 --> 08:04.720
That's really interesting huh.

08:04.890 --> 08:09.080
Well let's refresh the page OK.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.500
It just put it in there for us automatically.

08:11.530 --> 08:11.930
OK.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.450
Now that's really bad.

08:13.450 --> 08:15.910
And some browsers aren't as smart and won't fix this for you.

08:15.910 --> 08:22.150
So it's very very important no matter what that you always listen to your idea here your tool or more

08:22.150 --> 08:23.800
importantly that you always end your tags.

08:23.800 --> 08:24.390
OK.

08:24.670 --> 08:29.740
So it's a 4 and the higher if you go the smaller the fun gets right.

08:29.740 --> 08:30.980
Welcome to Dove slopes.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.820
OK so you definitely can do different types of tags here.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.450
And we lost her life preview of course.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.170
Let's open that up again.

08:39.660 --> 08:39.930
OK.

08:39.940 --> 08:42.070
So we've worked with Hetter so far.

08:42.220 --> 08:42.500
OK.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.030
Welcome bedevils Welcome to the slopes welcome to disclose welcome to do so.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.680
Welcome to the slopes.

08:47.890 --> 08:49.000
Pretty cool.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.860
And let's do one more thing.

08:50.950 --> 08:55.840
Let's go ahead and work with the title here in order to work with the title on your page you have to

08:55.840 --> 09:01.120
put in a head a head is typically not visible the things you put in it are not visible and that is typically

09:01.120 --> 09:04.690
where you load things like CSSA or external font files or things like that.

09:04.690 --> 09:14.170
However one is visible which is the title of your page so we can say dev slopes dev slopes learn to

09:14.170 --> 09:18.880
code and as you can see appear on the browser tab that is where that is specified is here in the head

09:19.420 --> 09:24.520
and in the title we do have an ending title tag here and we do have an ending head tag here and this

09:24.790 --> 09:25.990
is all coming together.

09:26.050 --> 09:30.780
Now I'm going to get rid of these other header tags because we only need one welcome the death.

09:30.790 --> 09:34.960
So you've learned a lot here you've learned again about the doc type which specifies which version of

09:34.960 --> 09:42.610
HTL you start your your web apps or your HTL files with a small tag and then a head tag if you want

09:42.610 --> 09:47.110
to put link things which we have not done yet and then we've got the body tag which is actually where

09:47.110 --> 09:48.810
your content will go.

09:48.960 --> 09:49.660
OK.

09:49.810 --> 09:56.290
And sometimes also people like to link files here at the bottom of the body tag as well to load after

09:56.290 --> 09:59.120
the body is loaded which is you can do that as well.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.460
And we talked about header's 1 through 5.

10:02.500 --> 10:07.360
You can read more about headers on the W3 references on the on on the Internet.

10:07.510 --> 10:09.040
And we're going to call this video done.

10:09.040 --> 10:15.280
You've just dived into the world web Velma and the subsequent videos we are going to finish building

10:15.310 --> 10:20.380
are very simple web site which is going to be quite ugly because there's no CSSA but we've got to start

10:20.380 --> 10:20.750
somewhere.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.740
So Mark Price it slopes dotcom.

10:22.780 --> 10:24.070
Movin on and for.
