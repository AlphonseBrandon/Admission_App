WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:06.120
This.

00:06.400 --> 00:07.980
Yo what's up everybody.

00:07.990 --> 00:09.820
Mark pricer devs slopes dot com.

00:09.820 --> 00:14.370
And welcome back to the coding party and this exciting video.

00:14.410 --> 00:22.540
We're going to learn how to work with tables and tables interesting thing you actually don't see a lot

00:22.540 --> 00:27.270
of tables being used anymore and each time they are used still completely valid.

00:27.460 --> 00:32.380
But what's crazy is these to be used everywhere in the beginning because in the beginning we didn't

00:32.380 --> 00:33.790
have things to style.

00:33.820 --> 00:39.520
We couldn't we couldn't put things where we wanted them to be so we started using tables for padding

00:39.520 --> 00:44.380
and for spacing and to put these things on the pages where we wanted them to be in a table literally

00:44.740 --> 00:47.760
like a table with rows and columns just like an Excel spreadsheet.

00:47.770 --> 00:48.160
OK.

00:48.220 --> 00:50.840
That is what a table is in each T.M. Exactly.

00:50.890 --> 00:54.700
And you can put data in it you can put whatever you want in images things like that.

00:54.850 --> 01:00.310
So I'll show you how we're going to use a table and the opportunities are endless in how you want to

01:00.310 --> 01:00.920
use them.

01:01.240 --> 01:06.670
But we're going to just create let's say on a page you know where you can go to deficit of ZCom and

01:06.670 --> 01:11.260
you can choose from some courses not just on the list of course as I want them kind of you know scattered

01:11.260 --> 01:14.220
across like in a nice series of columns.

01:14.290 --> 01:16.070
So let's go ahead and do that now.

01:16.540 --> 01:18.370
So we've got our paragraph there.

01:18.370 --> 01:21.510
So to create a table we're just going to say table.

01:21.580 --> 01:22.020
All right.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.400
And then you've got table rows inside of a table.

01:25.420 --> 01:28.620
So what we're going to do and then table data.

01:28.670 --> 01:31.520
So we're going to do is TR for table row.

01:32.010 --> 01:32.380
OK.

01:32.450 --> 01:34.480
So remember row column row column real column.

01:34.490 --> 01:37.750
So a table row to yours is a row.

01:37.820 --> 01:40.590
OK so think of the Excel one row always go down.

01:40.590 --> 01:42.940
OK columns go from left to right.

01:42.980 --> 01:44.030
So we've got a table row.

01:44.090 --> 01:48.550
And what I want to do is create some columns in here so I say Tee-Tee.

01:48.920 --> 01:55.260
And we're going to put a button in here and we're going to say iOS 10 course.

01:55.870 --> 01:56.380
OK.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.360
And as you can see we've got a nice little button there which is cool.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.880
So there's Iowas 10 course and let's make a couple of other things.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.600
You're just going to copy and paste these this table data.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.840
These are columns again.

02:06.850 --> 02:10.550
So with one row three columns and sort of the I was 10.

02:10.550 --> 02:18.180
Course we're going to say Android of course and then we're gonna say unity three-D course.

02:18.580 --> 02:19.240
OK.

02:19.610 --> 02:22.540
Notice over here on the right hand side we've got three buttons here.

02:22.550 --> 02:24.390
That's actually pretty cool.

02:24.590 --> 02:30.220
If I do say so myself and let's go out and create another table row let's do another row of data.

02:30.230 --> 02:35.140
I'm just going to copy this and paste it down here and again inside the button text.

02:35.180 --> 02:37.400
I'll be changing the text here.

02:37.470 --> 02:40.160
And what do I want to say.

02:40.370 --> 02:44.970
I get unit three and say web course OK.

02:45.550 --> 02:48.670
And then we're going to say nood API course.

02:48.790 --> 02:54.760
The Course of us that would be a great course to take after you've finished this course and we've got

02:54.760 --> 02:59.080
the angular two course which you know and you can take that one too after this course.

02:59.080 --> 02:59.640
Pretty good.

02:59.710 --> 03:02.540
Pretty good stuff in there actually.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.360
So this is pretty cool.

03:04.510 --> 03:08.470
We've got some buttons here and it's looking good in our nice little table.

03:08.590 --> 03:11.760
We can play around some of the settings here actually on the table.

03:11.760 --> 03:12.150
You want to.

03:12.190 --> 03:16.600
You don't have to do it purely NCEA says you can play with a few things here such as the border.

03:16.610 --> 03:17.940
So inside the table tag.

03:18.010 --> 03:18.590
OK.

03:18.880 --> 03:24.730
We're in the side the table tag there are some attributes that we can set inside this tag and such as

03:24.850 --> 03:27.310
the border equals.

03:27.310 --> 03:33.640
And what we want to say would if we said five Hey we got a ugly border there and sell padding.

03:33.640 --> 03:38.220
We can set that cell padding equals say 25.

03:38.660 --> 03:39.810
So I guess a nice spacing.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.740
Now some padding.

03:40.790 --> 03:41.780
OK.

03:41.790 --> 03:44.760
And what is a cell spacing This is the space between the cells.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.170
Say five.

03:46.390 --> 03:46.690
OK.

03:46.700 --> 03:47.940
Look at the difference.

03:48.270 --> 03:51.100
OK it's that line and between the cell spacing.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.100
OK.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.460
Now this is pretty dang ugly.

03:54.460 --> 04:00.950
I have to admit like I think it's I think it's pretty ugly but I think it's easily fixable if we just

04:00.950 --> 04:03.120
take up the borders I want to say a border zero.

04:03.170 --> 04:07.210
And look now we've got some nice core course buttons that are all aligned here.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.860
And so what have we done so far.

04:09.110 --> 04:10.540
OK we haven't done much.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.210
We put in a table OK.

04:12.250 --> 04:16.920
And inside a table we have a table row remember like Excel spreadsheets and you get confused.

04:17.270 --> 04:18.280
What do I do.

04:18.320 --> 04:24.530
Just think of Excel and then you know you have rows and columns rows go from top to bottom columns go

04:24.530 --> 04:25.490
from left to right.

04:25.490 --> 04:27.610
So inside of this row we have three columns.

04:27.620 --> 04:30.720
OK I was 10 and wrote in unity and then another row.

04:30.770 --> 04:36.440
So next one down well of course no the API coarsen angular course and we put these inside of a button.

04:36.440 --> 04:41.420
Ok so that it's clickable you know because we're going to pretend like there's more web pages and you

04:41.420 --> 04:43.150
could click and go to that web page.

04:43.160 --> 04:43.970
OK.

04:44.430 --> 04:47.210
It makes sense it's pretty cool.

04:47.210 --> 04:50.120
Very cool stuff there so we've got our buttons here.

04:50.410 --> 04:51.810
Cell padding 25.

04:51.860 --> 04:53.630
That's kind of high.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.400
It makes sense to bring it down.

04:56.810 --> 05:03.470
Maybe two or five say 10 that's a little bit better.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.000
Cool.

05:04.010 --> 05:10.410
So there's our stuff cell spacing you know we'll leave it right about there anyway.

05:10.520 --> 05:15.610
So there's your table here now maybe you're thinking to yourself wait a minute wait a minute mark I

05:16.180 --> 05:22.290
don't think I know how to make these links appear horizontally just like a real web page.

05:22.340 --> 05:25.290
OK so what I want you to do is I want you to pause his video.

05:25.580 --> 05:29.880
And I want you to take this list here and I want you to make it horizontal using a table.

05:30.190 --> 05:30.790
Mm hmm.

05:30.830 --> 05:35.470
Cagas puzzle video and make this horizontal and get back to me.

05:35.550 --> 05:39.360
Did you do it I know you didn't get second chance Pozza video.

05:39.360 --> 05:39.960
Go do it.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.430
Fellows you did do it.

05:41.460 --> 05:42.590
I'll show you right now.

05:42.660 --> 05:47.550
Let's make this let's put this into a table here which I think is a great idea.

05:47.550 --> 05:49.930
So what we're going to do is just add another table.

05:50.380 --> 05:51.040
OK.

05:51.420 --> 05:53.460
And that's what I'm going to have one row.

05:53.560 --> 05:57.670
So TR It's going to have three data three data columns in it.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.220
So.

06:00.000 --> 06:09.560
And all I'm going to do here is inside these TVs we're just going to command X and paste and then TDE

06:10.520 --> 06:15.870
and a command X and paste these these links here.

06:15.870 --> 06:16.170
OK.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.850
These tags.

06:18.450 --> 06:20.590
And then we're going to do one more time.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.940
Inside of this.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.130
Love it.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.470
And then we'll go ahead and get rid of this unordered list.

06:30.950 --> 06:32.560
Ooh look at that.

06:32.570 --> 06:33.290
Look at that.

06:33.290 --> 06:35.080
Now they're a little bit close right.

06:35.130 --> 06:36.640
So we don't have to help us out.

06:36.650 --> 06:40.990
But what we can do is we can go ahead and add some cell spacing.

06:41.060 --> 06:47.720
So let's just go here at this table put in some cell spacing let's say 10 Boehme a little bit further

06:47.720 --> 06:49.160
apart which is nice.

06:49.430 --> 06:51.250
OK so 10 between each one.

06:51.250 --> 06:52.220
I like it.

06:52.220 --> 06:53.870
And there we go about Hohmann course.

06:53.870 --> 07:00.630
Now we have a horizontal linked list here are links for our page which is pretty dang cool.

07:01.010 --> 07:02.970
So we've got some courses here.

07:03.020 --> 07:04.260
I'm really liking this.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.110
I'm really liking.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.220
Let's call this video done we've worked with tables.

07:07.220 --> 07:10.730
OK we've worked with table rows we've worked with the table data inside of the table rows.

07:10.730 --> 07:15.860
We put a little button in here we haven't talked about how to click the buttons and stuff but I think

07:15.860 --> 07:18.380
that's a better conversation for when we get to javascript.

07:18.380 --> 07:21.960
Right now we're just doing some static some static stuff here.

07:21.990 --> 07:22.860
Doesn't do much.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.320
And it's looking good coming together so let's call this done.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.630
Mark Price you're at does Loeb's dotcom moving on and forward.
