WEBVTT

00:05.340 --> 00:11.710
What's up ladies and gentlemen Mark Peiser with DENSELOW dot com and our very first website we're going

00:11.710 --> 00:16.630
to conclude in this video Vecsey gone quite a bit and I know you've watched a series of videos because

00:16.630 --> 00:20.530
I'm talking but like literally once you know all the stuff you can build this web page in less than

00:20.530 --> 00:22.460
five minutes which is pretty awesome.

00:22.900 --> 00:27.910
So what I want to do is just finish off the website a few more finishing touches here maybe embed a

00:27.910 --> 00:28.740
YouTube video.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.100
Ooh that makes sense right.

00:31.270 --> 00:32.450
So let's do that now.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.420
OK so we've got a table here.

00:34.420 --> 00:37.550
It probably makes sense to put another horizontal rule in here.

00:37.560 --> 00:41.020
H.R. and then a little line to break things up.

00:41.260 --> 00:45.490
And this time let's go ahead and pretend you know we're trying to sell something right so we won't have

00:45.490 --> 00:50.500
some bullet points as to why soap's is awesome and amazing so this time we're going to use an ordered

00:50.500 --> 00:50.880
list.

00:50.920 --> 00:51.760
Oh well.

00:52.060 --> 00:52.720
OK.

00:53.050 --> 00:54.760
And same format right list item.

00:54.820 --> 00:55.110
OK.

00:55.120 --> 01:02.140
So what I want to do is above this order list here is say you know why should you choose those right

01:02.150 --> 01:06.720
so we're going to say this time and H2 are too wide of slopes.

01:06.760 --> 01:16.950
So it is smaller than the first and the Suydam one is going to say real world real world coding.

01:16.960 --> 01:17.650
I like that.

01:17.830 --> 01:24.920
Maybe a real world cup cover dash the real world like the dash looks good.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.130
Real world coding.

01:26.230 --> 01:28.180
Can we build real apps right.

01:28.180 --> 01:31.960
Fun and exciting fun and exciting.

01:31.960 --> 01:37.870
Lots of terrible jokes to go around the side I'm affordable which it is.

01:37.870 --> 01:39.920
Some companies charge $200 a month.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.690
Not desktops you get all this for a very low price.

01:43.810 --> 01:53.660
So real world coding fun and exciting and affordable although I feel like I broke something fun and

01:53.670 --> 01:55.390
exciting affordable.

01:55.450 --> 01:56.680
I put in number one here.

01:56.770 --> 02:00.430
That's why that should be an L and and-I and this is also number one.

02:00.430 --> 02:01.120
Wow.

02:01.330 --> 02:04.890
Wow what did they do with these number ones here.

02:05.410 --> 02:07.570
I'm trippin out OK.

02:07.650 --> 02:08.810
Here you go.

02:09.400 --> 02:10.180
So list items.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.490
Boom boom boom.

02:11.520 --> 02:12.510
I like that a lot.

02:12.790 --> 02:14.310
OK great.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.900
Now you're not sold enough.

02:15.970 --> 02:16.250
Right.

02:16.250 --> 02:17.410
You've come the Web site.

02:17.620 --> 02:19.350
You're starting to feel good but you're not quite there.

02:19.350 --> 02:21.850
So now we need an actual video.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.320
You know MacDuff So it's really exciting so we're going to go to YouTube dot com slash see slash def

02:27.340 --> 02:32.780
slopes and find a really exciting video here this fact.

02:32.800 --> 02:33.790
This one's great.

02:34.190 --> 02:37.170
1385 use this is great.

02:37.180 --> 02:40.780
What does this add avocados from Mexico.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.370
Sorry getting distracted.

02:42.400 --> 02:47.550
We do not want any avocados from Mexico we American avocados.

02:48.160 --> 02:53.810
And so here's our I-frame.

02:54.040 --> 02:54.980
Ok cool.

02:55.320 --> 03:00.850
So I just wanted the embed and I grabbed the I-frame here and I'm just going to paste it under the ordered

03:00.850 --> 03:01.370
list.

03:03.030 --> 03:03.850
OK.

03:04.410 --> 03:05.120
And look at that.

03:05.130 --> 03:06.630
That is pretty darn cool.

03:06.660 --> 03:09.310
If I do say so myself.

03:09.750 --> 03:10.110
Wow.

03:10.140 --> 03:10.810
Really.

03:10.950 --> 03:12.010
Yeah I like it a lot.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.070
I like it a lot.

03:15.950 --> 03:19.190
Well give a nice little border to firm border.

03:19.190 --> 03:21.880
How about one yeah.

03:22.180 --> 03:23.300
So pretty cool right.

03:23.300 --> 03:26.370
The I-frame allows you to embed things I-frame is just a container.

03:26.470 --> 03:30.730
OK we're not going to go into all the depths of an I-frame the best way to learn how to code and build

03:30.790 --> 03:34.180
web apps is actually from building full scale web apps which we are going to be doing later in this

03:34.180 --> 03:35.080
course.

03:35.080 --> 03:39.910
I really don't like to teach every little thing and break it out because it can be very boring and mundane

03:40.300 --> 03:44.460
but just know the I-frame is available to you and you know you can do lots of different things with

03:44.460 --> 03:44.850
it.

03:44.850 --> 03:50.950
So now we get this cool video although I don't like the freeze frame that it really picked on it but

03:51.640 --> 03:53.070
it turned out pretty good here.

03:53.500 --> 03:53.720
OK.

03:53.740 --> 03:54.580
And of course you can play it

04:00.520 --> 04:02.780
Redfoo coder is pretty cool.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.930
LMI feel sexy and I know it.

04:06.190 --> 04:06.430
OK.

04:06.430 --> 04:08.800
So I-frame that looks good.

04:08.980 --> 04:11.910
So why does subs we've now picked it out you can of course change this.

04:12.200 --> 04:20.760
You know I don't have the aspect ratio dimensions so but if I said let's say 400 and let's get to 50.

04:20.790 --> 04:24.390
Again I don't know the aspect ratio I'm probably stretching it a little bit here but it's maybe a little

04:24.390 --> 04:28.160
bit better smaller like this which is fine allow full screen is fine.

04:28.200 --> 04:28.650
OK.

04:28.710 --> 04:29.640
So we'll leave that in there.

04:29.670 --> 04:33.490
And let's go ahead and put another H.R. just to break things up a little bit here.

04:33.560 --> 04:38.640
So our Web page is really coming together here and divide it under there.

04:38.660 --> 04:41.610
Last thing we probably on our page is a contact form of some kind.

04:41.620 --> 04:42.900
So let's go ahead and do that.

04:43.020 --> 04:49.960
Let's make another hetter say you want to say contact us or go the bottom here.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.140
And what else do we want here.

04:52.170 --> 04:55.850
How it formed so we can use the forum tag and we can put some elements in here.

04:55.860 --> 05:00.330
So what I want to do is say first name ok.

05:00.870 --> 05:01.370
Scroll down.

05:01.380 --> 05:07.830
There's the first name and what I want to do is put the input in here input type equals text.

05:07.830 --> 05:09.100
All right.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.560
And there's a box there now.

05:10.740 --> 05:14.270
I don't like how it's on the same line as you can see down here.

05:14.670 --> 05:19.300
So what I actually want to do is after the first name I want to break.

05:19.370 --> 05:24.090
So B R and B are you used to have to put a slash in there to close it but you don't have to do that

05:24.100 --> 05:24.660
anymore.

05:24.870 --> 05:25.320
OK.

05:25.350 --> 05:28.620
And we're going to do it again because I still don't like how close it is to the first name.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.930
I want a little bit or a little bit more space.

05:31.350 --> 05:35.210
So we go there's the first name and there's the box for the first name.

05:35.220 --> 05:37.190
OK this is looking pretty good.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.460
Yeah.

05:39.030 --> 05:45.540
And then let's go ahead and put a last name in it and say the last name.

05:45.930 --> 05:47.270
And we're going to say B R

05:51.380 --> 05:57.120
Maybe I'll take this one off and I'll put the B are on here and we'll do two on this one.

05:57.140 --> 05:57.860
That's better.

05:57.860 --> 05:58.860
I'd like that better.

05:59.180 --> 06:02.720
OK let's put another input input type equals text.

06:02.900 --> 06:03.460
OK.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.740
And we're going to just say

06:07.580 --> 06:14.820
Actually this should probably just be name and email your say email.

06:15.220 --> 06:16.440
OK.

06:16.670 --> 06:17.540
Type equals text.

06:17.540 --> 06:18.710
I like it.

06:18.710 --> 06:22.700
And let's do another B R and another B are to break the line.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.060
Break it up there a little bit.

06:24.440 --> 06:33.760
And then this one put a button in OK button is going to say submit submit like so I like it.

06:34.150 --> 06:36.800
Cool.

06:37.190 --> 06:39.850
Yeah let's see here.

06:45.750 --> 06:47.820
So I want to show you something here.

06:47.970 --> 06:48.730
We have two buttons now.

06:48.750 --> 06:54.840
One is actually a button tag and one is an input tag with a value of type submit and submit is just

06:54.840 --> 06:56.700
really a button and you can use either one.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.960
There's no right there's no one that's better than the other.

06:58.980 --> 07:00.900
And both of these can invoke javascript.

07:01.030 --> 07:04.280
OK so you're going to see this in this course and other places as well too.

07:04.290 --> 07:06.420
And you're also going to see an HMO that you can do more.

07:06.420 --> 07:09.860
One thing multiple ways and so submit and submit.

07:09.870 --> 07:10.150
OK.

07:10.170 --> 07:14.490
We're going to leave the button just for sake of clarity right now and look at this we've got a contact

07:14.490 --> 07:16.630
form you put your first name in.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.140
Even refreshes the page.

07:18.140 --> 07:18.920
Look at that.

07:19.020 --> 07:21.530
You can put your name in and your email in it.

07:21.540 --> 07:22.950
And I think that's pretty cool.

07:22.980 --> 07:27.690
Welcome to those who got our links up here a little bit of text here.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.320
The courses that you can buy Why does slopes.

07:30.360 --> 07:35.450
And then we've got this video here that you can watch and it's all coming together.

07:35.760 --> 07:36.540
That's it.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.730
We've really built our first web site here.

07:39.750 --> 07:40.780
And the crazy thing is.

07:40.790 --> 07:42.750
Here is the crazy thing.

07:43.260 --> 07:48.110
What you just learned here is 95 percent of the time that you'll be using every day.

07:48.120 --> 07:51.130
And I'm not saying that you're not going to use javascript or other things you will.

07:51.360 --> 07:58.860
But my point is I started working on our Web site actually dustups Web site and I'll show you right

07:58.860 --> 08:00.140
here I'll show you.

08:00.270 --> 08:04.860
We just at time of recording we came out this book.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.140
OK.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.320
So I'll tell you what I quoted I coded up today.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.240
I slung some code today.

08:11.280 --> 08:11.970
Click the book tab.

08:11.970 --> 08:12.970
I built this whole web page.

08:12.970 --> 08:13.750
OK.

08:14.310 --> 08:14.820
All right.

08:14.820 --> 08:15.930
Pretty cool right.

08:16.350 --> 08:26.130
And everything that we've basically used except maybe the image tag really everything that we've used

08:27.390 --> 08:28.730
today is what I use.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.080
I didn't use anything else.

08:30.180 --> 08:32.020
I didn't even use tables I used.

08:32.280 --> 08:37.370
Right here I used an unordered list took off the bullet points and these are just p tags here.

08:37.380 --> 08:40.570
This is like an h n H2 H1.

08:40.740 --> 08:41.770
This is just a buy in.

08:41.850 --> 08:43.010
This is just a header here.

08:43.020 --> 08:44.150
This is another.

08:44.160 --> 08:45.390
This one's in an ordered list.

08:45.390 --> 08:48.350
The only one I haven't showed you is an image which I'm going to show you right now.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.520
How do we get you know images on our Web site.

08:51.600 --> 08:57.680
Of course what kind of coding Web site do we have without having some type of image.

08:58.350 --> 09:01.690
So let's just see what the Internet has to say about that slopes.

09:01.710 --> 09:02.980
Good images.

09:03.540 --> 09:04.970
Oh look at this nice little logo.

09:05.010 --> 09:06.270
I like that a lot.

09:06.270 --> 09:07.260
You image.

09:07.560 --> 09:11.790
Let's go ahead and just take this image here a logo for a web site.

09:11.790 --> 09:12.490
All right.

09:12.870 --> 09:19.290
And let's go over here to our Web site and maybe inside the body we're just going to place an image.

09:19.650 --> 09:25.040
I am the source equals we're going to paste in the image.

09:25.180 --> 09:26.190
OK.

09:28.010 --> 09:34.240
Impress safe and see what happens and we get that we have a nice little image here.

09:34.260 --> 09:37.950
Actually it's pretty huge but cool.

09:37.980 --> 09:42.580
We've got an image on our Web site and I think that's pretty darn cool.

09:43.660 --> 09:50.740
Things were probably going to want to do just for sake of completion is give it an alternate tag slopes

09:50.740 --> 09:57.490
logo this is in case the image can't load for some reason or let's say accessibility so is blind and

09:57.490 --> 10:02.000
the computer reads to them it's going to say you know dad slopes logo is going to read it out to them.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.490
So we want to put that in there.

10:03.550 --> 10:07.300
And also I don't like how big it is at all.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.450
Let's just assume it's a square.

10:08.450 --> 10:10.140
It may not be but we're going to say right.

10:10.150 --> 10:19.330
Let's say 100 and set the width to win 100 as well to keep everything.

10:19.330 --> 10:23.740
Always of course in double quotes as we've been doing in this video so far.

10:23.740 --> 10:29.610
And let's go ahead and go find our life.

10:29.810 --> 10:30.970
There we go.

10:30.990 --> 10:34.040
And as you can see the image is resized which is pretty cool.

10:34.250 --> 10:37.540
Maybe it makes more sense to put the logo in front of the Welcome to the slopes.

10:37.580 --> 10:38.560
So I think I want to.

10:38.960 --> 10:43.580
Well I guess it is there it's just brought it down on the new line because the head are there.

10:43.820 --> 10:44.530
OK.

10:44.530 --> 10:47.940
So yeah I think it's fine.

10:47.960 --> 10:48.720
So there you have it.

10:48.740 --> 10:54.680
We've got an image I could have put this in a table if I wanted to make my logo next to this here.

10:55.070 --> 10:55.790
So I do it.

10:55.850 --> 10:56.460
OK.

10:56.630 --> 11:02.600
OK we'll make another table make another table again.

11:02.630 --> 11:07.520
You don't have to work with tables in the new H.M. because you have CSSA of course.

11:07.520 --> 11:12.470
So what I want to do is this time I only have two columns and in the first column we're going to have

11:12.470 --> 11:18.660
the logo like this K loop.

11:18.660 --> 11:22.140
And the second one is going to have the header like so.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.630
Put it right in there.

11:27.610 --> 11:28.570
Save it.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.090
OK cool.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.900
Welcome to death slopes there's a logo.

11:31.970 --> 11:32.170
OK.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.630
There are the three links.

11:33.630 --> 11:37.810
Now of course you want to be linking an image from a random Twitter page probably not because it may

11:37.810 --> 11:41.710
not always be available we probably want to download it and reference it locally but this is fine for
