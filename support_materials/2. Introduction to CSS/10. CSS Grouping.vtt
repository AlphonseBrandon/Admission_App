00:08.360 --> 00:09.230
A what is up.

00:09.230 --> 00:11.900
Everybody this is Jason with slopes dot com.

00:11.900 --> 00:19.520
And in this video we are going to talk about CSSA grouping now grouping in CSSA is a technique used

00:19.520 --> 00:26.870
to help reduce code redundancies so many times in your in your code or your success you're going to

00:26.870 --> 00:31.940
have different selectors that are going to have the same declarations on them.

00:31.940 --> 00:39.350
So for example let's go ahead and get rid of this head or two here and I'm going to take this one.

00:39.560 --> 00:46.040
And just for example purposes go ahead and copy that and then paste it two times.

00:46.370 --> 00:46.980
All right.

00:48.180 --> 00:48.410
All right.

00:48.420 --> 00:49.280
So we've got that.

00:49.290 --> 00:55.350
And then let's just pretend this is a class of some sort and then pretend this is like an idea of some

00:55.350 --> 00:55.980
sort.

00:56.070 --> 01:03.300
So we might have this one tag in our page and then a class and an ID somewhere in it and they have the

01:03.300 --> 01:07.500
same exact style declarations on them right.

01:07.500 --> 01:13.500
So what we can do is you can actually take these and group them all together into one declaration.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.260
And here's how in your head or one here.

01:16.260 --> 01:17.620
Go ahead and put a comma.

01:17.910 --> 01:22.490
And for this I'm going to put a head or two comma and head or three.

01:22.500 --> 01:27.540
All right go ahead and just delete this class an ID example that we had down here.

01:27.990 --> 01:32.960
All right so we've got a group here of a head or one head or two and a head or three.

01:33.270 --> 01:37.570
And we're assigning a color of white.

01:37.650 --> 01:40.050
We've got a text shadow on this.

01:40.050 --> 01:48.710
And what we're saying is every head or one and every head or two and every head or three apply this

01:48.710 --> 01:50.060
style rule to it.

01:50.100 --> 01:50.620
OK.

01:50.820 --> 01:55.010
So go ahead and save that and then come over to your HTL.

01:55.080 --> 02:00.530
We're going to add a head or three here and go ahead and write whatever you want.

02:00.540 --> 02:01.450
I'm going to write.

02:01.500 --> 02:06.270
I wish Red Bull gave me wings.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.640
I do I wish.

02:07.920 --> 02:08.250
All right.

02:08.250 --> 02:09.820
So we've got a head or three in here.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.840
And then I'm going to I just kind of want to define these.

02:12.870 --> 02:22.980
So put one there and put a head or two here give a space and then go ahead and put a head or three awesome

02:23.410 --> 02:26.850
and then so we can get some more headers here.

02:26.950 --> 02:32.480
Let's see where our container closes closes here right at the bottom.

02:32.740 --> 02:35.430
Outside of this go ahead and add a better one.

02:35.800 --> 02:44.560
And then we're going to do a head or one example I should build tree swing and then we can do another

02:44.560 --> 02:51.180
one here with a head or two and go ahead and add that to there and put.

02:51.250 --> 02:52.110
Let's see.

02:52.210 --> 02:57.550
I hope the rope doesn't break.

02:57.610 --> 02:58.100
All right.

02:58.120 --> 02:58.540
Cool.

02:58.570 --> 03:00.540
I hope it doesn't break now.

03:00.550 --> 03:02.560
So we've got a few different headers on here.

03:02.560 --> 03:07.080
Let's go ahead and save that and then launch it and let's preview this

03:09.930 --> 03:10.320
all right.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.350
So cool.

03:11.430 --> 03:16.000
So we've got all of our head on one so we grouped the ones twos and threes together we can see it's

03:16.000 --> 03:19.470
applying our white fun and our tech shadow in there.

03:19.470 --> 03:20.980
Pretty cool stuff.

03:20.990 --> 03:23.910
Now let's do something else we can.

03:24.840 --> 03:29.100
We can actually add one more style rules to this.

03:29.100 --> 03:39.750
We can go ahead and add a line height of let's just put one rim unit there and then we can even go ahead

03:39.750 --> 03:44.310
and add a font family of like sans serif here.

03:44.730 --> 03:51.450
OK so what we're doing here is we're taking a group where we're setting a standard for these elements

03:51.450 --> 03:57.330
here we're saying hey every single head are one two and three we are going to apply these style rules

03:57.330 --> 04:04.620
to it and then down the road if we want to change a color or a font family on some of these letters

04:05.100 --> 04:10.980
you can go ahead and add classes to those and get a little bit more specific with your style rule so

04:10.980 --> 04:18.280
you can target the specific specific head or one tags for example that you want to change.

04:18.510 --> 04:24.840
And in this not only can we you know grab just elements selectors if you wanted to group like a class

04:24.840 --> 04:31.470
and here you could go ahead and throw a class and here if it has this same style rules and you can even

04:31.470 --> 04:33.070
go ahead and add an ID.

04:33.390 --> 04:39.930
Just make sure that every single one of these is separated by a comma and you can literally add infinite

04:41.070 --> 04:48.540
elements classes and ideas inside of this and then apply a standard for a style rule here so very cool

04:48.540 --> 04:50.760
stuff so style rules.

04:51.090 --> 04:55.500
I mean CSSA grouping is very helpful.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.700
It's going to do a couple of things.

04:56.700 --> 05:00.200
It's going to help the redundancy of your code.

05:00.210 --> 05:06.060
It's going to save you time from repeating the same style rules to different elements.

05:06.060 --> 05:11.560
It's also going to help the browser load your page a lot quicker by grouping this.

05:11.670 --> 05:16.980
It's not going to have to read as so many classes or different style rules that you assign to these

05:16.980 --> 05:18.840
so cool stuff.

05:18.840 --> 05:19.980
Very very helpful.

05:19.980 --> 05:22.370
That is CSSA grouping.

05:22.680 --> 05:23.390
Let's move on.
