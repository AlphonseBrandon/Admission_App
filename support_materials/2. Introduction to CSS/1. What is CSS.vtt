The

00:09.260 --> 00:10.460
hey what's up everybody.

00:10.460 --> 00:13.190
This is Jason with slopes dot com.

00:13.340 --> 00:17.680
And in this video we're going to do a quick introduction to what success is.

00:17.870 --> 00:20.330
And a little bit of the history behind it.

00:20.330 --> 00:22.540
So what is the assess.

00:22.700 --> 00:25.400
Well CSSA is a cascading style sheet.

00:25.640 --> 00:26.630
Let me pull this up for you.

00:26.630 --> 00:34.120
This is dev slopes Web site CSX allows us to take control of the design and the layout of the website.

00:34.130 --> 00:38.170
It allows us to position things in a nav bar at the top here.

00:38.180 --> 00:44.870
It allows us to place images and style our font and change the color and the text size.

00:44.870 --> 00:56.790
Now we we are in version 3 of the SS CSSA one was first introduced in the early 1990s but introduced

00:56.810 --> 01:01.520
really basic things like adjusting the font size and color of things.

01:01.550 --> 01:08.090
It made web design a little bit easier but it was still really really limited and it really didn't gain

01:08.090 --> 01:17.150
traction with browsers until the early 2000s when Explorer 5.0 came out for the Macintosh and it supported

01:17.150 --> 01:21.200
over 99 percent of CSSA one.

01:21.200 --> 01:29.090
So it was a really big deal then and then it wasn't until early 2000s that CSSA 2 came out which was

01:29.090 --> 01:30.390
awesome.

01:30.440 --> 01:38.000
It introduced a lot of things like positioning and Z indexes which allowed web designers to place elements

01:38.000 --> 01:41.970
on a web page literally anywhere that they wanted to.

01:42.200 --> 01:47.380
I found this web site is really hard for me to find actually because everything is so up to date.

01:47.570 --> 01:53.190
I believe this is probably something that is built with CSSA too.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.120
They were able to center things here.

01:55.130 --> 02:00.980
They changed some of the text color and of these little goofy little images here.

02:00.980 --> 02:06.380
You'll also notice that this isn't mobile compatible.

02:06.380 --> 02:10.300
See how I'm having to scroll horizontally here side to side.

02:10.400 --> 02:16.070
The web site isn't mobile compatible and that's where CSSA 3 comes into play.

02:16.220 --> 02:20.910
CSSA 3 is really what paved the way for Responsive Web design.

02:20.960 --> 02:29.960
It introduced a lot of the media equerries that would detect like a browser with on a desktop or a mobile

02:29.960 --> 02:35.950
device and then allowed web developers to design and make mobile responsive web sites.

02:36.050 --> 02:41.810
And it also introduced a lot of fun other things like animations and really cool other styling properties

02:41.810 --> 02:42.620
as well.

02:42.630 --> 02:51.150
So Jess our guy Jess he designed this Web site you can see it's mobile compatible here.

02:51.530 --> 02:55.960
Everything conforms moblie here the nav bar has collapsed.

02:55.970 --> 02:58.070
We've got a drop down things like that.

02:58.070 --> 03:02.100
So that's what CSSA is in a nutshell.

03:02.180 --> 03:08.480
We're going to be covering everything there is about CSSA 3 and how to apply it in real world web site.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.940
All right so that's it for this video.

03:10.970 --> 03:14.030
Let's let's get rock in with some CSSA three.
